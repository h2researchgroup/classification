0,1,0,Where Do Interorganizational Networks Come From?,"Organizations enter alliances with each other to access critical
                    re‐sources, but they rely on information from the network of prior
                    alli‐ances to determine with whom to cooperate. These new alliances
                    modify the existing network, prompting an endogenous dynamic be‐tween
                    organizational action and network structure that drives the emergence of
                    interorganizational networks. Testing these ideas on alliances formed in three
                    industries over nine years, this research shows that the probability of a new
                    alliance between specific organi‐zations increases with their
                    interdependence and also with their prior mutual alliances, common third
                    parties, and joint centrality in the alliance network. The differentiation of
                    the emerging network structure, however, mitigates the effect of interdependence
                    and en‐hances the effect of joint centrality on new alliance

1,0.5,1,Civil Rights Law at Work: Sex Discrimination and the Rise of Maternity,"By the time Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, many employers had created maternity leave programs. Analysts argue that they did so in response to the feminization of the workforce. This study charts the spread of maternity leave policies between 1955 and 1985 in a sample of 279 organizations. Sex discrimination law played a key role in the rise of maternity leave policies. Building on neoinstitutional theory, this article explores how the separation of powers shapes employer response to law. Details of the law are often specified in administrative rulings‐the weakest link in the law because they can be overturned by the courts and by Congress. Yet an administrative ruling requiring employers with disability leave programs to permit maternity leave, which employers successfully fought in the courts, was at least as effective as the identical congressional statute that replaced it. In the American context, the legal vulnerability of administrative rulings can draw attention to them, thus making the weakest link in the law surprisingly powerful.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/210317,1999,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_210317

Using data from a random sample of firms in Shanghai, the author shows that there are two situations that cause this uncertainty: economic instability, where weak firms struggle to survive in the rapidly changing market system, and administrative instability, where large firms that were the most protected are now being forced to handle the responsibilities that were previously handled by the state. The result is that both types of firm seek stability by spreading out risk through investment in low‐risk, fast‐return markets, revealing much about the economic reforms.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/231084,1997,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_231084

Integrating these two approaches yields the thesis that social networks affect economic growth via enforcing informal institutions. The article focuses on the economic payoff of kinship networks in the context of China’s rural industrialization to argue that kin solidarity and kin trust played an important role in protecting the property rights of private entrepreneurs and reducing transaction costs during the early stages of market reform, when formal property rights laws were ineffective and market institutions underdeveloped. Data from 366 villages show that the strength of kinship networks has large positive effects on the count and workforce size of private rural enterprises and insignificant effects on collective enterprises.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/382347,2004,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_382347

This observation, articulated by Stinchcombe in 1965 and known today as the “organizational imprinting hypothesis,” is frequently cited but remains little understood. Advances in cultural sociology and entrepreneurship studies have provided tools for unpacking this process. The author draws on these tools to underscore the role played by entrepreneurs in selecting and incorporating historically specific elements that may remain for decades or even centuries as fundamental features of the organization in question.

Expanding on old debates, these data and analyses validate the importance of organizational and class cohesion approaches to corporate political action. Methodologically, the political unity of pairs (dyads) of firms in trade policy activism is analyzed with quadratic assignment procedure regression. Shared membership in prominent policy networks and board interlocks positively predict corporate political unity across three areas of trade policy influence, from the executive branch to the legislature. Non-network organizational indicators also significantly predicted corporate trade policy activism. The findings support business unity accounts of corporate political action and suggest that higher levels of firm embeddedness within intercorporate networks facilitate collective corporate political action.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/657524,2011,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_657524

Employing documentary sources and 87 predominantly oral history interviews, the article presents a historical sociology of the clusters of evaluation practices surrounding ABSs (asset-backed securities, most importantly mortgage-backed securities) and CDOs (collateralized debt obligations). Despite the close structural similarity between ABSs and CDOs, these practices came to differ substantially and became the province (e.g., in the rating agencies) of organizationally separate groups. In consequence, when ABS CDOs (CDOs in which the underlying assets are ABSs) emerged, they were evaluated in two separate stages. This created a fatally attractive arbitrage opportunity, large-scale exploitation of which sidelined previously important gatekeepers (risk-sensitive investors in the lower tranches of mortgage-backed securities) and eventually magnified and concentrated the banking system’s calamitous mortgage-related losses.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/659639,2011,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_659639

This article demonstrates that detailed examination of the temporal unfolding of negotiative processes contributes to our understanding of the bundle of tasks which comprise organizational settings.

When actors are structural equals in groups, an observable interaction order
         emerges from interaction processes. When we experimentally impose authority, skill, or sentiment structures, structural advantage is related to longer speech durations. When structures are combined such
         that an actor is advantaged in more than one social structure, then the actor engages in shorter speech durations, although dominance (as measured by perceived contributions to the group) remains high for
         the actor. In addition, the likelihood that an actor contributes a solution to a group problem or invites other contributions is highly dependent on whether the preceding speech included positive feedback.
         The expected interdependence between contributions and invitations to contribute was not evident in our data. Thus our research provides new insight on the sequential dependencies between speech acts in

0,1,1,Flexibility and Fairness: Effects of the Network Form of Organization on Gender Equity in Life Science Careers,"Why do women have more opportunities in some employment settings? I investigate how organizational form affects gender stratification among life scientists. I propose that firms governed by networks, rather than bureaucracies, allow for greater equity. Hierarchy and rules hide gender bias, while reliance on ties outside the organization provides transparency and flexibility. I analyze the careers of 2,062 U.S. life scientists and interviews with 41 scientists. I examine employment data by gender for two patterns: early entrance into the biotechnology industry and promotion within network and hierarchical organizations. Gender does not affect when a scientist enters the biotech industry but is related to promotion. Men are more likely to attain early supervisory-level positions across organizational settings. Female scientists are nearly eight times more likely to supervise in biotech firms than in more hierarchical settings. The two organizational forms—network and hierarchy—provide different employment experiences for female scientists.

0,0,1,Leadership Structures in Same-Sex Task Groups,"ABSTRACT: This article investigates contradictory findings reported in the literature concerning differences in leadership differentiation between same-sex groups. Drawing on arguments developed by Walker et al. (1996) addressing measurement validity in this literature, and on an extension in the status literature developed by Ridgeway (1988) and Fennell et al. (1978), this article develops and tests three predictions. Specifically, the authors predict greater differences in leadership differentiation between allmale and all-female groups when assessing leadership based on procedural behaviors than when assessing leadership based on influence. Also, leadership differentiation will be greater in all-male groups within a male-dominated organization, and in all-female groups within a female-dominated organization, than in all-female groups within a male-dominated organization when assessing leadership based on procedural compared with influence behaviors. Contrary to predictions, results show that all-male and all-female groups are equally likely to develop differentiated leadership structures when using procedural- and influenced-based measures. Implications of these results are discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sop.2006.49.3.391,2006,Sociological Perspectives,10.1525_sop.2006.49.3.391
0,0,1,"Ethnic Matching of Supervisors to Subordinate Work Groups: Findings on ""Bottom-up"" Ascription and Social Closure","Research on minority authority attainment tends to stress top-down processes of social closure, whereby the dominant social group produces and preserves positions of power and influence by excluding out-group
         members. We argue that this view, while helpful, is incomplete. Returning to Weber's original conceptualization of social closure, we argue that top-down exclusion often generates pressures for bottom-up
         ascription, whereby employers match supervisors to the social characteristics, particularly race and ethnicity, of their subordinate work groups. Results from the Multi-City Survey of Urban Inequality strongly
         support our argument and also reveal that bottom-up ethnic matching reduces perceptions of racial discrimination among subordinates. These results offer a useful corrective to the assumption that elites

Findings from nationally representative survey data reveal significant white male advantage in the number of job leads received through routine conversations when compared to white women and Hispanics. Differences in social network resources (social capital) partly explain the deficit among Hispanics, but fail to account for the job lead gap between white women and men.

0,0,1,The “State” of Equal Employment Opportunity Law and Managerial Gender Diversity,"Women’s underrepresentation in management is a persistent social problem. We take a new approach to understanding the lack of managerial gender diversity by investigating how U.S. state equal employment opportunity laws are related to women’s presence in upper and lower management. We draw on data from 2010 EEO-1 reports documenting managerial sex composition in U.S. work establishments and a state employment law database to answer our research questions. State mandates are found to be differentially associated with upper- versus lower-level managerial gender diversity. Establishments in states with an equal pay law, or that once ratified the ERA, employ more women in upper management than those in states without such a law or in nonratifying states, but this holds only in establishments in industries that typically employ women. In contrast, establishments in states that require anti-discrimination workplace postings employ fewer women in upper-management than those in states without such a requirement. State equal pay laws, especially those adopted before federal equal pay legislation, family responsibility discrimination protections, and past ERA ratification are positively associated with women’s lower-level managerial presence. Conversely, state expanded family and medical leave coverage, prohibited sex discrimination, and specific posting rules are negatively associated with women’s presence in lower management. Results hold net of establishment, state, firm, and industry factors. We discuss the meaning behind differences across managerial level and the role of state regulation in moving toward greater managerial gender equity.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2014.12319,2005,Social Problems,10.1525_sp.2014.12319
1,1,0,Government Regulatory Powers and Church Autonomy: Deviant Groups as Test Cases,"The current proliferation of legal conflicts over ""church autonomy"" reflects the incompatibility of two contemporary tendencies: 1) the functional diversification of constitutionally protected religious organizations; and 2) the expanding regulatory mandate of the state to enforce public accountability of organizations for harmful or fraudulent practices. This paper examines several cases involving the financial practices of deviant movements, including the conviction of Sun Myung Moon for tax evasion and the intervention of the California Attorney General in the finances of the Worldwide Church of God. These cases have elicited widespread concern among mainline church leaders, who appear to interpret them as boundary-defining engagements whose outcomes will yield rules applicable to the legal status of churches in general. These cases illustrate the difficulties faced by churches in attempting to legitimate diversified structures of economic rationality in terms of (individual) freedom of religious conscience.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1385815,1974,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1385815

Ironically, the churches with the highest numbers of church friends per attender are either stable or declining. Newcomers find such churches ""cliquish"" because high-tenure members have as many friends as they want or can manage. The ability of church friendship networks to incorporate newcomers appears to decline as average tenure and number of church friends increase. In contrast, attenders of the two growing churches have lower attendance tenure, fewer church friends, and greater desire for additional church friends. They are thus more inclined to incorporate newcomers, which further facilitates their growth.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386575,1981,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1386575

Drawing upon Schutz's phenomenology of social relations, we amplify theoretically the Durkheimian perspective and suggest that the universalization process is stimulated by an increase in anonymity (as opposed to intimacy) in society. Structural factors consistent with anonymity -- i.e., increasing population density, political and economic differentiation, and monetary exchange -- are hypothesized to influence the universalization of ritual occasions. A recursive path model is devised for the hypothesized relationships in the universalization process. We find support for the model using data from a cross-cultural sample of nonindustrial societies.

The reports are divided into ""Type I"" and ""Type II"" reports, with the former being thorough-going in their anti-cult orientation, and the latter reports being more moderate in tone, with some attention paid to scholarship on new religions. However, the major thesis of the study is supported, as an examination of both types of reports reveals that they incorporate ""brainwashing"" and ""mind control"" imagery imported from the United States, even though such theories have been largely discounted within the United States. Use of such theories leads directly to some questionable policy recommendations, as demonstrated in the reports.

Much of this work depicts involuntary minority cultures as internally uniform. This article challenges the oppositional-culture explanation in three important ways: (1) by demonstrating that through the religious tenets and practices of the Nation of Islam (NOI), young female members develop a black achievement ideology, resulting in the adoption of the kind of studious orientation to school that is usually demonstrated by voluntary immigrant groups; (2) by demonstrating the ways in which black people differentially make sense of and enact what it means to be black that challenge previous binary or dichotomized accounts of black oppositional social identity; and (3) by illustrating how resistance for NOI young women is transformative, as well as reproductive, of existing patterns of social, racial, and gender relations.

The analysis makes several contributions to the literatures on hegemony, resistance, and the law. First, by demonstrating the importance of medicine's assertion of its authority for the expansion and mobilization of the alternative birth movement, we show that the mobilization of the law by a dominant group may trigger the emergence of social movements seeking to resist hegemonic understandings and arrangements. At the same time, by examining how birth activists' organizational resources developed over time and were rendered meaningful in legislative debates, our study demonstrates the importance of avoiding dichotomous conceptions of structure and culture. In addition, by analyzing culture as a process of meaning-making rather than an independent and hierarchical set of values, the analysis shows how cultural and legal hegemony--even that of modern medicine--may be destabilized, even as it sets the terms of the effort to destabilize it and shapes the nature of the hegemony that will replace it.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1555122,1992,Law & Society Review,10.2307_1555122

This study investigates both the factors that contribute to the chances of clergy experiencing harassment, and the impact of abuse on clergy work outcomes. Because there is so little research on the sexual harassment of clergy, the more general literature on sexual harassment in the workplace (from organizational and sociology of work research) must be relied on in framing the study. A unified approach is used, which suggests that features of modern organizational structures which are known to increase satisfaction will help to create a supportive climate in the workplace that will reduce the likelihood of incidents of harassment.

0,1,1,Turkish Migrants' Organizations: Promoting Tolerance toward the Diversity of Turkish Migrants in Germany,"Since the beginning of their migration, Turkish migrants (TMs) have formed numerous civic organizations of diverse types in Germany. Various studies have examined the social, economic, and political situation of Turkish migrants in Germany over the past fifteen years. A gap persists concerning the role of Turkish migrants' umbrella organizations (TMUOs) as antiracist organizations and representatives of the Turkish migrant community. While they establish relations with German political parties, trade unions, and municipal authorities, it is unclear whether such interactions are motivated by TMUOs' interest in promoting tolerance toward the diversity of Turkish migrants in Germany. Combining approaches from organizational sociology and migration research, this article aims to generate an empirically founded knowledge of TMUOs and how they have reacted to various German policies of acculturation. It is specifically concerned with: (1) the aims and activities of TMUOs; (2) the role and function of these organizations as representatives of the Turkish population; (3) the methods and strategies that TMUOs use to influence the German policy and public in order to eliminate racism toward Turkish migrants; and (4) the possibilities available to them to promote antiracism in Germany. The article shows that many organizations were established because of social, economic, and political discrimination against TMs in Germany. It shows that TMUOs are involved in activities to support TM integration into the German society as well as in defensive moves to protect them from discrimination. My main argument is that TMUOs' efforts to support the integration of TMs into the German society have generally been ignored. These organizations are excluded in many cases from negotiations with the government and thus have limited impact on the growth of Turkish minority rights in Germany.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20628330,2008,International Journal of Sociology,10.2307_20628330

The results indicate that in areas of interpersonal relations and housing, teachers and educators do harbor prejudicial attitudes; however, educators are comparable to other professionals regarding these attitudes and less prejudiced than laborers, farmers, clerical workers, craftsmen, managers, and administrators. Within the teaching profession, kindergarten and elementary teachers appear slightly more racially prejudiced than secondary school teachers.

A path analysis indicates that two sets of protester-controlled factors decisively affect protest group success: organization and beliefs and goals. Of the two, beliefs and goals is the more significant, although bureaucracy is very important for recognition. For the most part, the impact of protester-controlled factors is not due to the reaction of third parties; however, revolutionary activism, one factor in the realm of beliefs and goals, is a notable exception. Revolutionary activism's negative association with success is largely due to suppression by third parties.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20831203,1981,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20831203
0,0,1,Reducing Occupational Sex Segregation: Explaining Failure and Success,"Recent developments in theory and public policy regarding occupational sex segregation are reviewed and evaluated. It is argued that the shift away from individual and sex role explanations and toward structural explanations is an important step forward. In particular, socialist feminist and labor market segmentation theories provide useful frameworks for understanding the obstacles to occupational integration. However, in order to understand both the failures and the successes of attempts to reduce segregation, a neo-Weberian conflict model is more fruitful. This model recognizes that social outcomes may reflect the power of capital or patriarchy, but they may also reflect sources of power and group interest which cut across those categories. The usefulness of this approach is illustrated through an examination of three empirical questions: 1) Why did the rate of sex segregation decline for the first time in the 1970's; 2) Why did segregation decline significantly more in some occupations than others; and 3) Why have corporate executives become more favorable in their attitudes toward affirmative action? Answers to these questions are sought by examining the role of state power and the groups which influence it, the interests of management at different levels of the organization, and the interests of union leaders and members.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20831459,1988,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20831459

In the late nineteenth century, blacks and Italian immigrants in the urban North vied for a niche serving whites in barbering. Applying human ecology theory, I explore this rivalry, analyzing inter- and intra-group competition with data from the Census of 1900. As I hypothesized, black men were displaced from their barbering niche by competitive exclusion, i.e., their concentration in this niche was reduced by the entry of Italian men into the niche, and by niche saturation, i.e., the number of potential black entrants to the niche exceeded the niche's capacity to absorb them, exacerbating competition among black men for positions within the niche. Also as I hypothesized, Italian men, who ranked higher in the ethnic queue, were not inhibited by niche saturation and thus had greater opportunity to exploit their barbering niche. The analysis of this historical case of ethnic competition demonstrates that principles of human ecology can be used to draw general conclusions about the rivalries that occur between and within minority groups for valued occupational niches in the economic mainstream.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20832170,2002,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20832170

This paper is an effort to link theories of social movement framing with the methodology of discourse analysis. In the following, an online debate over the legitimacy of protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States provides qualitative data for a discourse analysis of microlevel framing processes. The debate occurred on a university listserv and involved more than 100 messages offered by 67 individuals over 16 days. Analyses reveal four distinct framing contests in the discourse. An initiating contest regarding a specific antiwar protest is found to generate three additional contests, the first about antiwar protests more generally, the second about the war in Iraq itself, and the third about the appropriateness of holding such a debate on a listserve sent to university employees.

Those cultural elements which characterize an interacting group are termed the idioculture of the group. This approach focuses on the content of small-group interaction, and suggests that the meanings of cultural items in a small group must be considered in order to comprehend their continued existence as communication. Five characteristics of cultural items affect which items will become part of a group culture. Cultural forms may be created and continue to be utilized in situations if they are known to members of the interacting group, usable in the course of group interaction, functional in supporting group goals and individual needs, appropriate in supporting the status hierarchy of the group, and triggered by events which occur in group interaction. These elements have impact only through the interpretations of group members of their situations.

Drawing upon the work of Epstein (1970) and the theoretical apparatus of status characteristics theory (see Berger et al., 1977), we explore one means by which these inequalities may be reduced--the disconfirmation of established gender-based expectations. The results of two experiments--one involving females and one involving males--show that disconfirmation does in fact reduce tasks inequality for both women and men. The results also support predictions based on the combining and attenuation principles of status characteristics theory.

We conceptualize positional power as embedded in the structural relations among interconnected spheres of production in the economy. We maintain that positional power is a three-dimensional construct. It entails (1) the ability of workers in a given industry to disrupt operations of other industries ""upstream"" in the production process, (2) the ability to disrupt operations ""downstream"" in the production process, and (3) the ability to disrupt production locally within their own industry. After developing new measures of these three dimensions from interindustry input-output flow matrices, we estimate the impact of positional power on three labor outcomes: (a) labor's organizational capacity, (b) labor militancy, and (c) labor's economic standing. Our findings suggest that positional power positively influences all three of these dimensions.

Professionals at higher levels of government were more likely than those at lower levels to do favors and provide information, particularly when they were more central in the professional network.

The system characteristic of the leading sectors of U.S. industry provides immediate benefits to workers at the cost of undermining their control over work and their ability to mobilize for collective action. The radical theory implies that the system initially increased wages but eventually led to a decline because of these long-term effects on control and organization. I examine wages in U.S. manufacturing industries between 1947 and 1987, first distinguishing groups of industries within which wages move together. Data on collective bargaining provisions are then used to verify that the resulting groups are related to systems of labor control. Regressions are fit for wage changes in each group and significant period differences are found in the core group.

Industrial dominance is defined as the proportional overrepresentation of the local labor force in a given industry or industrial sector. A contextual analysis of census microdata for the largest 125 SMSAs shows that, within industries and sectors, workers in metropolitan areas in which their industry is dominant have significantly higher earnings than workers in areas in which that industry is less dominant. These results hold for two different measures of dominance and four race/sex groups. The effects of local dominance on earnings appear stronger for industries in the core and state sectors, for financial, business and personal service functions, and for public administration. The influence of dominance is partly explained by the tendency of locally dominant industries to be composed of larger establishments.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095809,1986,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2095809

As organizations expand beyond minimalist conditions of existence, states and markets offer alternative solutions to the core problems of persistence: obtaining resources, managing competition, and constructing legitimacy. By analyzing the movers and stayers in a population of state bar associations that split into two co-existing forms of organization--one primarily reliant on the market and the other primarily dependent on the state--we demonstrate that a two-stage transition to a new form can be explained by the complementary interplay of resource dependency and neo-institutional theories. Organizations are more likely to move from reliance on the market to reliance on the state if (1) their market performance has been unsuccessful, (2) states are willing and able to solve organizational problems, (3) organizations are younger and less established, and (4) compelling alternative models have been propagated by moral entrepreneurs and adopted by influential states.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096074,1988,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096074

The theory combines an image of social network structure with the concept of natural selection to model changes in group composition over time. We consider the group to be a population of members subject to natural selection in sociodemographic space. According to the theory, the probability that members will enter or leave the group depends upon the number and strength of social network ties that connect group members to each other and to nonmembers. We analyze an event history dataset constructed from interviews using the Life History Calendar method and information on ego-centered social networks developed from the General Social Survey Network Module. We test the hypothesis that network connections inside a group are associated with reduced membership turnover, while connections outside the group increase turnover. We find that weak ties and network connections that span greater distances in sociodemographic space are positively correlated with leaving current groups and joining new ones.

I analyze data on insurgency in the Paris Commune of 1871 and show that organizational networks and pre-existing informal networks interacted in the mobilization process, even in the final moments of the insurrection. Network autocorrelation models reveal that enlistment patterns in the Paris National Guard created organizational linkages among residential areas that contributed to solidarity in the insurgent effort, but the efficacy of these linkages depended on the presence of informal social ties rooted in Parisian neighborhoods. Thus the role of network factors can only be understood by studying the joint influence of formal and informal social structures on the mobilization process.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096251,1980,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096251

Building on these two perspectives, we examine the impact of an occupation's external market--the extent to which it offers systematic within-occupation movement among employers--on internal job mobility and protection structures and the availability of grievance procedures. Data from a sample of Chicago workers and their employers confirm aspects of both market and institutional theory.

In general, the results are supportive of the model: both conceptions of a task and task predictability (or known technology) appear to affect coordination through other structural characteristics of the unit.

Results of studies comparing employed women, employed men, and housewives have been mixed, however, and investigators have begun to consider additional explanatory factors. This paper focuses on a potential source of gender differences in distress that has received relatively little attention: the workplace itself. I consider the extent to which work conditions and the sexual segregation of occupations are related to two measures of distress: demoralization, which is more prevalent among women, and drinking, which is more prevalent among men. Multiple regression analyses indicate that the only work-related factors associated with demoralization are substantive complexity and full-time work, and these have an effect among women only. Full-time work and low levels of complexity are associated with higher levels of demoralization among women. Substantive complexity is also associated with drinking, but only among men; as complexity declines, levels of drinking increase. These findings indicate the importance of considering work-related factors and measures of distress associated differentially with gender when investigating gender differences in distress.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136847,1976,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_2136847

Agency theorists generally assume that shareholders are homogenous and that their influence on firm performance is directly proportional to the percentage of equity they hold. However, empirical research following this approach has failed to produce definitive evidence. Class analysis perspectives interpret these inconclusive results as demonstrating that, regardless of ownership organization, firms are run to serve the capitalist class. An alternative interpretation is that shareholders are not homogeneous but that certain types of shareholders use their formal authority, social influence, and expertise to ""capture"" property rights and strongly influence firm performance.

Results indicate that patient satisfaction and likelihood of adherence are related to communication comfort. Additionally, patients seeing a physician of their own race are more likely to adhere to instructions than those seeing a physician of a different race, although the effect of race-concordance is not as strong as communication comfort. Interestingly, race-concordance is not related to patient satisfaction. We conclude that both communication comfort and race-concordance play major roles in the patient-physician relationship.

The British produced knowledge about the Malays through scholarly writings in history books and the creation of the census report. This knowledge was, for the most part, constructed and did not necessarily correspond to the social reality of the Malays. The education system played a vital role in transmitting this knowledge to the masses, thus beginning a process of internalisation on their part. This led to a rapid disintegration of Malay cultural practices and way of life as they comprehended alien Western concepts, such as history, territory and community. The nationalist movement in present day Malaysia with its emphasis on race and boundaries attests to the degree to which the British has succeeded in transforming the identity of the Malays. The core of this paper is aimed at demonstrating the connection between British administrative procedures and its impact in reconstructing the thought patterns of the people.

Our findings suggest that ethnic disadvantages primarily result from social rather than from specific ethnic inequalities, since initial differences in the chances of attaining the Abitur disappear after considering educational and social origin, the only exception being Italian young adults.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23889512,2007,Ethnicities,10.2307_23889512

Using qualitative research conducted in Greenwich, London and via an engagement with political and media discourses, he traced the emergence of a new theme within white racism. This article will outline the origins and development of 'white backlash', from Conservative MP Enoch Powell's infamous 'Rivers of Blood' speech in 1968 through Thatcherism, and examine the re-emergence of notions of 'unfairness' to whites as a result of the actions of both New Labour and the British National Party (BNP). Using qualitative interviews with BNP voters in Burnley, Lancashire, England, the way in which individuals sought to 'justify' their actions with recourse to notions of 'unfairness' and 'equality' will be examined. It will be suggested that BNP supporters viewed multiculturalism and its perceived allies, positive discrimination and political correctness, to be the harbingers of a policy that institutionalized the exclusion of white residents.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23890858,2010,Ethnicities,10.2307_23890858

Findings from Hong Kong,"This article aims to ascertain whether organizational life and informal connections, which made up part of Putnam's (Bowling alone: the collapse and revival of American community. Simon & Schuster, New York, 2000) Social Capital Index, have separate effects on social cohesion. Postulating that informal gatherings with family and friends might be a functional alternative to associational life, we employed multiple regression analysis to test the hypothesis. The analysis was based on a 2011 territory-wide door-to-door survey in Hong Kong. Controlling for the effects of demographic variables including gender, age, educational level, and employment status, it was found that formal participation in organizations contributed significantly to the explanation in five of the eight subindexes of social cohesion. In contrast, informal connections contributed significantly only to one subindex. The pattern persisted when attitudinal variables such as life satisfaction, social support, and perceived social class were added to the regression analysis. In short, our analysis demonstrated that participation in formal organizations fosters various aspects of social cohesion, and that this effect cannot be replaced by informal gatherings with family and friends.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24721456,2014,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_24721456
0,1,0,Brokers and the Earnings of Female Sex Workers in India,"This study examines whether working with a broker increases or reduces the payment received for the last client among female sex workers. Building on research on the informal economy and sex work, we formulate a positive embeddedness hypothesis, expecting a positive association, and an exploitation hypothesis, expecting a negative association. We analyze a large survey combined with intensive interview data on female sex workers in Andhra Pradesh, India. These data uniquely distinguish between the amount the sex worker actually received and the amount the client paid. The analyses show that brokers are associated with significantly lower last payment received. Although brokers are associated with a greater number of clients in the past week, this does not result in significantly higher total earnings in the past week. Further analyses suggest that much of the negative relationship with earnings is due to the fact that brokers lead to a lack of control over the amount clients are charged. At the same time, the results fail to show that brokers actually provide services of value. Ultimately, the results support the exploitation hypothesis. We conclude by encouraging the refinement of theories of embeddedness and exploitation and calling for greater research on workers in the informal economy of developing countries.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24756411,2015,American Sociological Review,10.2307_24756411

One theoretical perspective predicts that an increase in interaction between two actors will promote subsequent convergence in their attitudes and behaviors, whereas another view anticipates divergence. We examine the role of political identity in moderating the effects of interaction on influence. Our investigation takes place in the U.S. Senate—a setting in which actors forge political identities for public consumption based on the external constraints, normative obligations, and reputational concerns they face. We argue that interaction between senators who share the same political identity will promote convergence in their voting behavior, whereas interaction between actors with opposing political identities will lead to divergence. Moreover, we theorize that the consequences of political identity for interpersonal influence depend on the local interaction context. Political identity's effects on influence will be greater in more divided Senate committees than in less divided ones. We find support for these hypotheses in analyses of data, spanning over three decades, on voting behavior, interaction, and political identity in the Senate.

Agricultural advisors have been shown to play important roles as information intermediaries between scientists and farmers, brokering, translating, and adding value to agronomic and economic information of use in agricultural management decision making. Yet little is known about the readiness of different types of agricultural advisors to use weather and climate information to help their clients manage risk under increasing climate uncertainty. More than 1700 agricultural advisors in four midwestern states (Nebraska, Indiana, Iowa, and Michigan) completed a web-based survey during the spring of 2012 about their use of weather and climate information, public or private sector employment, and roles as information intermediaries in three advising specializations: agronomic, conservation, and financial. Key findings reveal that advisors who specialize in providing agronomic information are positively inclined toward acting as weather and climate information intermediaries, based on influence and willingness to use climate information in providing many types of operational and tactical advice. Advisors who provide conservation advice appear to be considering weather and climate information when providing tactical and strategic land-use advice, but advisors who provide financial advice seem less inclined to act as climate information intermediaries. These findings highlight opportunities to increase the capacity of different types of advisors to enable them to be effective weather and climate information intermediaries.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24907419,2015,"Weather, Climate, and Society",10.2307_24907419

This article addresses questions concerning the position, centrality and influence of sports organizations as one specific part of civil society, and is based on an approach providing information on networks between categories of organizations. These networks consist of overlapping affiliations to organizations which are then interpreted as structures making communication, persuasion and influence possible. From these networks, position, centrality and potential influence of sports organizations in civil society are analysed. The article also looks more specifically at the links between sports and seven other types of voluntary organizations. The data is based on Norwegian surveys from 1982, 1990, and 2003, providing the possibility to follow sports organizations over a period of 20 years. The results show that sports organizations are influential due to size, but relatively weakly embedded and positioned in civil society. This position is, however, strengthened compared to most other organizations during the last 20 years. Regarding the relation of sports to other specific organizations some type of 'normalization' seems to have taken place, and sports are socially 'closer' to most organizations in 2003 than in 1982.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25209140,2008,European Sociological Review,10.2307_25209140

Prisons symbolize, mirror, and shape the communities and countries in which they exist. Although prisons informed and were intertwined with many of the defining moments of 1989, in the 20 years since, societies often failed to recognize the important role prison and punishment play in relationship to democracy. By not recognizing that ""prison matters"" in relationship to democracy, polities (whether in transition to democracy or established democracies) failed to adequately learn ""prison lessons."" Starting with a case study of South Africa, this paper considers prisons during apartheid and under democratic governance. This case is connected to other comparative and international examples (including Russia, Brazil, and the USA) to identify five lessons learned and not learned concerning prison and democracy. First, policies and practices of imprisonment reflect social orders, especially structures of inequality and understandings of legitimate power and opposition. Second, countries transitioning to democracy seldom anticipate rising crime and invariably neglect the relevance of prisons. Third, nations do not adequately grapple with the role of prison in the past, especially the nondemocratic past. Fourth, in established and recent democracies, penal populism resulted as politicians defined prison as a solution to a host of social ills, ignoring the consequences of expanded punishment. Fifth, prisons shaped key substantive realities beyond their walls, from leadership to recidivism, scandals, fiscal deficits, and crises of legitimacy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25621933,2009,"International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society",10.2307_25621933

Nonconformity may also be driven by economic factors such as market growth and financial returns. Most of these sources of nonconformity were confirmed in a study of the competitive repertoires of the major U.S. airlines. The findings also show that competitive nonconformity was associated with subsequent declines in financial performance, but mainly for smaller airlines with homogeneous markets.

These four traits are measured with three different methods: reports from a respondent chosen through a probability sample from the community, reports from an official of the group, and estimates from direct measurement of the traits at an organizational meeting. Results of the analysis suggest that the three measures are parallel with one another in the sense of Lord and Novick 1968. This result means that the three methods are equally desirable. Surprisingly, the direct canvass measure does not appear to be more reliable than the others; on the contrary, it appears to be equivalent to other reports for the traits measured. There is a slight suggestion in the data that officials in the group are more accurate than ordinary respondents in reporting information about less salient characteristics of the members, such as years of education.

Given men's initial preponderance in management, we argue that inertia, sex labels, and power dynamics predispose organizations to use sex-based ascription when staffing managerial jobs, but that personnel practices can invite or curtail ascription. Our results-based on data from a national probability sample of 516 work organizations-show that specific personnel practices affect the sexual division of managerial labor. Net of controls for the composition of the labor supply, open recruitment methods are associated with women holding a greater share of management jobs, while recruitment through informal networks increases men's share. Formalizing personnel practices reduces men's share of management jobs, especially in large establishments, presumably because formalization checks ascription in job assignments, evaluation, and factors that affect attrition.

Neoinstitutionalists argue that the process often begins when a policy shift undermines the status quo; groups then vie to define the best alternative. The authors explore the role of power in selecting between two alternative business models available to railroads from 1897, when antitrust laws banned the cartel-the prevailing model for managing competition. Predatory railroads prescribed several methods for destroying rivals. Financiers prescribed amicable mergers instead, and fought predation by threatening to withhold capital from predators. An analysis of the 167 rail acquisitions in Massachusetts between 1825 and 1922 confirms that the financiers succeeded. After antitrust laws were enforced, railroads left cartels to follow the business model of financiers rather than that of predators. This can be seen in the conditional variables that predict buying and selling. Thus public policy and power can shape key market features. It is ironic that this market, built by antitrust, became the prototype for the neoliberal ideal of the unregulated economy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657540,1980,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657540

We view the ecology of organizations as a determinant of worker expectations of outside opportunity and connect characterizations of organizational size diversity and inequality with job matching and firm reputation theory on how worker expectations are affected by organizational characteristics. This leads to the predictions that greater organizational diversity and inequality within a sector of the labor market will cause more intrasector job changes and fewer intersector job changes. We test these predictions on intra- and interindustrial and regional job changes, yielding supportive results on both industrial and geographical job mobility.

We examine how three factors affect changing access to managerial positions: (1) industrial restructuring, (2) the process of bottom-up ascription, and (3) organizational characteristics. Accounting for compositional shifts in the labor supply, we find that white male managerial overrepresentation remains virtually unchanged since 1966, even while other status groups make gains. A significant portion of the observed equal opportunity advance for women and blacks takes place in the expanding service sectors of the economy. We also find that female and minority gains are enhanced in larger and more managerially intensive workplaces. For all groups, managerial representation is increasingly tied to the presence of similar others in nonmanagerial jobs. Further examination reveals a new status hierarchy of managers and subordinates—a hierarchy wherein white men are likely to manage men of all races.

Another project, drawing from Polanyi's [1944 (2001), 1957, 1977] social theory, concerns the integration of the economy into broader social systems. Critically, these two formulations of embeddedness involve different views of the relationship between the economic and the social.

Research in this area has been hampered by the complicated and multi-step nature of the job-finding process and by the lack of appropriate comparison data for demonstrating the various ways in which minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities. We seek to specify what it means to say that minorities are cut off from job networks. Building on the literature on social networks in the labor market, we delineate the various mechanisms by which minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities. We examine how these mechanisms operate, using unique data on the chain of network contacts that funnel to an employer offering desirable jobs. We find that network factors operate at several stages of the recruitment process. We find scant evidence, however, that these network factors serve to cut off minorities from employment in this setting. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and methodological implications of the case for the study of networks, race, and hiring.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038975,2006,American Sociological Review,10.2307_30038975

Previous research based on analyses of aggregate national trends in occupational segregation suggests that sex and race/ethnic employment segregation has declined in the United States since the 1960s. We add to the existing knowledge base by documenting for the first time male-female, black-white, and Hispanic-white segregation trends using private sector workplace data. The general pattern is that segregation declined for all three categorical comparisons between 1966 and 1980, but after 1980 only sex segregation continued to decline markedly. We estimate regression-based decompositions in the time trends for workplace desegregation to determine whether the observed changes represent change in segregation behavior at the level of workplaces or merely changes in the sectoral and regional distribution of workplaces with stable industrial or local labor market practices. These decompositions suggest that, in addition to desegregation caused by changes in the composition of the population of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission monitored private sector firms, there has been real workplace-level desegregation since 1964.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/30039010,2006,American Sociological Review,10.2307_30039010

This paper analyzes the factors which led to the development of this judicial experiment as well as the reasons for its demise. The success or failure of this experiment was closely tied to long-term economic and political goals of the Cuban government, which eventually came to require an institutionalized bureaucratic cadre to operate its judicial system. This shift doomed the popular courts and led to the emergence of the legal profession as one of the most influential groups within Cuban society.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3053489,1973,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3053489

The analysis shows how prosecutors construct discordant locales through their categorization of victims, defendants, jurors, and their communities and the location of crime incidents. It demonstrates how prosecutors use discordant locales to justify case rejection. By ascribing stereotypical characteristics of a neighborhood to victims, defendants, and jurors, prosecutors construct distinct groups with different cultures who live in geographically separate spaces and have different schemes through which they interpret the everyday world. To construct discordant locale categorizations, prosecutors employ race, class, and gender imagery. Through this imagery they construct multiple normative standards of moral character of persons and of places.

The framework groups the variables into three major components. The first component includes characteristics of the innovation itself, within which two sets of variables are defined concerning public versus private consequences and benefits versus costs of adoption. A second component involves the characteristics of innovators (actors) that influence the probability of adoption of an innovation. Within this component six sets of variables concern societal entity of innovators (either people, organizations, states, etc.), familiarity with the innovation, status characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, position in social networks, and personal qualities. The third component involves characteristics of the environmental context that modulate diffusion via structural characteristics of the modern world. These latter characteristics incorporate four sets of variables: geographical settings, societal culture, political conditions, and global uniformity. The concluding analysis highlights the need in diffusion research to incorporate more fully (a) the interactive character of diffusion variables, (b) the gating function of diffusion variables, and (c) effects of an actor's characteristics on the temporal rate of diffusion.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3069244,2002,Annual Review of Sociology,10.2307_3069244

Works by Braverman, Edwards, and Burawoy, in particular, have made significant, though divergent, steps in that direction. It is argued in this paper, however, that their works do not go far enough in connecting issues of race, gender, and citizenship (political inequality) with structures of control over the labor process. An analysis of data from a case study of the labor process in an agribusiness (lettuce) industry is employed to highlight the importance of citizenship and gender as statuses constructed external to economic organizations but applied internal to them. Three principal arguments are derived from that case study: (1) that differences in citizenship status and gender serve to distinguish among labor market participants; (2) that nonmarket processes affect not only the distribution of individuals into positions in the labor process but also provide distinct advantages to employers in the creation and maintenance of different labor processes; and (3) that citizenship and gender have a material basis external to the labor process, that is, they are not simply labels attached to workers.

Recent studies have focused on relations between new ascendant social movements like the civil rights, women's, and peace movements that emerged during the postwar cycle of protest, and therefore have been unable to address this question. Focusing on revitalization as a qualitatively different form of intermovement relation, the authors examine the possibility that civil rights movement insurgencies and organizations revitalized workplace labor militancy during the postwar decades. Time-series models show that the civil rights movement fueled an expanded militant worker culture that challenged management and sometimes union leadership. However, this revitalization of labor militancy was contingent on institutional context (stronger in the public sector than the private sector) and form of insurgent action (protests, riots, organizations) differentially embedded in historical phases (civil rights versus Black Power) of movement development.

There is no difference in the income returns to job authority among men at the lowest levels of authority. However, among men at the highest level of authority, there is a substantial net difference favoring whites over blacks.

This paper demonstrates the significance of these three factors by investigating the empirical case of temporary workers. Using interview and observational field data, I demonstrate how a system of temporary employment in a participative workplace both exploited and shaped entry-level workers' aspirations and occupational goals.

We use what we term gender similarity and gender difference models to frame this investigation.

In contrast, the gender difference model assumes deeply rooted institutional and individual bases of gender difference. Analyses of data from a 3-year panel survey of 99 women and 312 men owners show more support for the gender similarity than the gender difference model. There is considerable gender similarity in the processes through which business and individual characteristics affect personal earnings, although women owners are disadvantaged in some characteristics critical to business success. Family situation has a direct impact on these owners' business success and indirectly affects personal earnings. We uncover vestiges of traditional gender roles consistent with the gender difference model, but primarily in the context of marriage.

Do the initial mobilization advantages of social capital persist, however, as movement organizations evolve? And do the strategies pursued by social movement organizations affect these advantages? We investigate these questions through a broad empirical analysis of factors affecting the short-term persistence of local chapters of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). Reasoning that multiple forms of social capital would each have a positive impact on survival, we assess the independent effect of several indicators of social capital with mixed results. Consistent with prior research, we find that access to patronage at founding and a greater stock of weak ties in the community confer survival advantages. Yet SMOs that emerged from preexisting groups and those with leaders previously tied to one another through civic engagement were less likely to persist, raising a first cautionary flag about the generality of advantages of resource co-optation and ""bloc recruitment."" The effect of preexisting, strong ties among group leaders varies by how much emphasis the group placed on victim aid activities.

First, concerning the monetary consequences, we test our hypotheses empirically by analysing the 2001 International Social Survey Programme on social relations and support systems. We show that using social ties is a common job-search strategy in all countries. However, using social networks does not increase the monetary pay-off. Second, we use a sample of 8,000 Swiss university graduates who recently entered the labour market to show that informal job-search channels are beneficial with respect to important non-monetary job characteristics. Thus, graduates who received their jobs through social contacts tended to get jobs that are linked to their educational degree and offer better career perspectives. Furthermore, using personal networks is related to lower search costs.

Moreover, studies typically obtain average estimates of social capital effectiveness across broad age ranges, obscuring variation across the life course. Analysis of early career and mid-career job matching shows that non-searching is associated with significant advantages over formal job searching. However, these benefits accrue only during mid-career and primarily among highly experienced male nonsearchers.

In this article, we focus theoretical attention on the importance of status-based power differentials and organizational context for the emergence of supervisory bullying in employment. Our multimethod analyses, which draw from content-coded organizational ethnographies (N = 204), highlight the importance not only of structural and social vulnerability - such as being in a racial minority or of a low occupational position - but also of chaotic and disorganized workplaces. Poor workplace organization, we show, creates positive motivations for supervisory bullying.

1,0,0,Non-Profit Foundations in Four Countries of Central and Eastern Europe,"The paper presents an analysis of roles and visions of foundations in four Central and Eastern European countries: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Poland. It offers a comparative account of the relevant legislation and the paths taken by these four foundation sectors in the aftermath of the 1989-91 democratic régime changes. They are depicted against a background characterized, among other things, by a partial demise of the state and rapid development of non-profit organizations. Using the methodology and conceptualizations of the research project Roles and visions of foundations in Europe, the authors describe the role profiles of foundations in these countries. They distinguish between role expectations of foundation stakeholders and the roles foundations are actually able to perform, given existing constraints such as legal regulations and limited own resources. The roles are further analyzed as parts of broader social visions in which foundation representatives and other stakeholders in the four CEE countries prefer to locate them. The dominance of certain roles and visions is explained with reference to specific features of post-communist societies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41274965,2006,Polish Sociological Review,10.2307_41274965

Examining the Relationship between Gender, Occupation, and On-the-Job Training Investments","This article aims to examine whether the access to initial on-the-job training differs by gender and to what extent gender differences can be explained by occupational segregation, human capital, and the division of labour in the household. While much research has focussed on formal on-the-job training, I use a measure of initial on-the-job training, or the amount of formal and informal training required to perform a job well. Data come from the Swedish Level of Living Survey 2000 (n = 2,913) and multilevel regression techniques are used. The results show that occupational segregation has a clear mediating effect on the gender difference in initial on-the-job training. The gender gap is reduced by one third when occupation is controlled for and training is related to the number of women in the occupation. Yet, a considerable gap is found also between men and women in the same occupation. This is not explained by human capital investments, nor by female overeducation in relation to the requirements of the job. The gender gap widens in the ages around 30, but factors such as motherhood, work interruptions, and housework are not related to on-the-job training, and part-time work explains very little of the gender gap.",external-fulltext-any,2012,European Sociological Review,10.2307_41495132

I conducted participant observation and interviews in a multi-ethnic, workingclass organization which combines two community organizing models: a relational model and an institutionally-focused model. Members of the organization collectively critiqued dominant ideologies and public policies about welfare and engaged in dialogue with political authorities about economic issues. In these processes, experiences of collective identity formation and personal identity transformation increased members' political motivation and sense of empowerment relative to the welfare system and other dominant institutions. I argue that the implications of identity formation and transformation are important in evaluating the success of community organizing efforts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41675005,2002,"Race, Gender & Class",10.2307_41675005

By the 1920s, however, the structural shifts within the larger political economy were challenging the nature of the Jewish working-class community as a racialized counterpublic. While the male leadership of the ILGWU embraced these changes and advocated for a centralized, expert-led model of communication within the union, Jewish women took a more progressive approach and fought for a model of labor education that facilitated the maintenance of a democratic, ethnic counterpublic in the face of mass culture. The ultimate triumph of the male leadership within the union culminated in the commercialization of its largest effort in mass education—radio station WEVD.

The movement is one of deconstructing all intuitive representations of a border-defined, thing-like system. The radical version that emerges leaves the operation as the sole and unique systemic constituent. The article shows that such a strain of thought contracting an extensive transitive structure into a purely operative core has major philosophical antecedents: Aristotle's conception of the actuation of life or intellection in a composite being, Fichte's self-position of the transcendental I, Heidegger's subject and authorless 'Ereignis' constitute very similar figures of 'operativization'.

In the current context of globalization, social scientists have examined the mechanisms by which organizational practices are transferred when transnational corporations establish subsidiaries in other countries or when international nongovernmental organizations collaborate with partners in the developing world to create externally developed prescriptions translated into locally viable action. Comparatively little work, however, has been done on the challenges of exporting, from one cultural and political context to another, an institution of higher education or a particular model for how higher education should be practiced. Although a variety of actors feature in the process of conveying organizational practices and cultural scripts, this article focuses primarily on the role of accreditation agencies and the practice of accreditation. In theorizing the relationship between the following four actors, i.e., external accrediting agencies, locally based quality assurance organizations, ministries of higher education, and Western universities located in the Gulf, Noori argues that the New Medievalism provides an analytically useful explanatory framework for understanding issues of governance with respect to American-style universities in the Gulf region.",external-fulltext-any,2013,"International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society",10.2307_42636450

Despite the rapid increase in corporate debt and prevalence of mergers and acquisitions, researchers have not examined whether these changes have affected corporate form change. The purpose of this research is to examine causes of change from the multidivisional (MDF) to the multilayered subsidiary form (MLSF). The MLSF is a corporation with a hierarchy of two or more levels of subsidiary corporations with a parent company at the top of the hierarchy operating as a management company. Methods. Using logistic regression analysis, we examine causes of change to the MLSF in the largest 100 U.S. industrial corporations. Results. Although corporations organized some of their assets as subsidiaries throughout the twentieth century, corporations began to organize more of their assets as subsidiaries in response to capital accumulation constraints (e.g., rising debt, increasing competition) in the early 1980s. Continued economic constraints resulted in corporate political behavior in the mid-1980s that produced changes in state business policy. These policy changes provided a political-legal structure for tax-free corporate restructuring of divisions as subsidiary corporations. Change in state business policy also provided a means for corporations to merge, acquire, and spin off subsidiary corporations tax-free. The results show that corporations' with more mergers and acquisitions, more long-term debt, liabilityprone product lines, and declining dividends are significantly more likely to change from the MDF to the MLSF.

Financial penalties, or sanctions, are a core mechanism for enforcing the work requirements of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and helping clients achieve self-sufficiency. This study's objective is to examine whether sanctions are being administered consistent with policy goals of encouraging work. Methods. This study uses administrative fair hearing decisions, which are the product of an adversarial-style procedure triggered when a client appeals an adverse decision by the agency, including work sanctions. Qualitative content analysis is used to analyze the decisions. Results. The study found that despite organizational reforms, local offices had created the welfare-to-work version of an eligibility-compliance culture, where sanctions were based primarily on attendance records and became a paper-processing function. Transactions between clients and workers were often routinized and mechanical, resulting in improper and arbitrary sanctions that were reversed by the hearing officers nearly 50 percent of the time.

Yet some states with large urban centers, notably Washington and Kentucky, resisted this seemingly inexorable trend for years. What explains their resistance? Furthermore, why did Washington—a state with a strong teachers' union and long-standing Democratic political control (resources for charter resistance identified in prior research)—ultimately adopt charters in 2012 while Kentucky has not? I use comparative-historical narrative analysis to trace differences in charter battles in the urban centers of the two states. I find that supporters framed charters as the solution in both cases but varied in their ability to name public schools as the problem in the first place.

1,0,0,"The Worldwide Expansion of ""Organization""","We offer an institutional explanation for the contemporary expansion of formal organization—in numbers, internal complexity, social domains, and national contexts. Much expansion lies in areas far beyond the traditional foci on technical production or political power, such as protecting the environment, promoting marginalized groups, or behaving with transparency. We argue that expansion is supported by widespread cultural rationalization in a stateless and liberal global society, characterized by scientism, rights and empowerment discourses, and an explosion of education. These cultural changes are transmitted through legal, accounting, and professionalization principles, driving the creation of new organizations and the elaboration of existing ones. The resulting organizations are constructed to be proper social actors as much as functionally effective entities. They are painted as autonomous and integrated but depend heavily on external definitions to sustain this depiction. So expansion creates organizations that are, whatever their actual effectiveness, structurally nonrational. We advance institutional theories of social organization in three main ways. First, we give an account of the expansive rise of ""organization"" rooted in rapid worldwide cultural rationalization. Second, we explain the construction of contemporary organizations as purposive actors, rather than passive bureaucracies. Third, we show how the expanded actorhood of the contemporary organization, and the associated interpnetration with the environment, dialectically generate structures far removed from instrumental rationality.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43187345,2013,Sociological Theory,10.2307_43187345
1,0,1,Dilettante or Renaissance Person? How the Order of Job Experiences Affects Hiring in an External Labor Market,"Social actors who move across categories are typically disadvantaged relative to their more focused peers. Yet candidates who compile experiences across disparate areas can either be appreciated as renaissance individuals or penalized as dilettantes. Extant literature has focused on the comparison between single versus multiple category members and on skill assessment, hindering its applicability. To discriminate between more versus less successful category spanners, I suggest that the order of accumulated experiences matters, because it serves as an indicator of commitment. I propose the concept of erraticism and predict that employers will prefer candidates who demonstrate some erraticism, by moving incrementally between similar jobs, over candidates who do not move and also over those with highly erratic job histories. Furthermore, I suggest this relationship holds for more complex jobs, less experienced freelancers, and is attenuated through working together. These issues are particularly salient given the rise of external labor markets where careers are increasingly marked by moves across traditional boundaries. I test and find support for these hypotheses with data from an online crowd-sourced labor market for freelancing services, Elance. com.

0,0,1,Who's the Boss? Explaining Gender Inequality in Entrepreneurial Teams,"Sociologists have examined gender inequalities across a wide array of social contexts. Yet, questions remain regarding how inequalities arise among autonomous groups pursuing economic goals. In this article, we investigate mixed-sex entrepreneurial teams to unpack the mechanisms by which gender inequality in leadership emerges, despite strong pressures toward merit-based organizing principles. We theorize the potentially competing relationships between merit and gender and explore the contingencies moderating their effects. Drawing on a unique, nationally representative dataset of entrepreneurial teams sampled from the U.S. population in 2005, we use conditional logistic regression to test our hypotheses. We demonstrate that merit's effect becomes much larger when multiple merit-based criteria provide consistent predictions for which team member is superior to others, and when entrepreneurial founders adopt bureaucratic templates to construct new ventures. However, gender stereotypes of leaders pervasively constrain women's access to power positions, and gender's effect intensifies when spousal relationships are involved. Women have reduced chances to be in charge if they co-found new businesses with their husbands, and some family conditions further modify women's chances, such as husbands' employment and the presence of children.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43187538,2014,American Sociological Review,10.2307_43187538

In developing such a firm, there are certain minimum requirements that obviously must be met from the outset: for instance, the acquisition of an office as well as certain types of hardware and office equipment is a necessity. In addition, developing such an organization means hiring professional and administrative staff who will support the work. A second aspect which is of critical importance -- and also a pre-requisite to obtaining work -- is establishing credibility. This assures prospective clients that the service which the organization provides is of the highest professional quality. Learning how to deal with clients, however, is a key to obtaining work — the third element of critical importance. Indeed, when writing proposals in response to RFP's issued by government agencies, there are specific guidelines that, if followed, may increase the chances of getting a particular job -- whether this job is at the federal, state, or local level. Finally, the success of the organization will ultimately depend on the marketing strategy that is used to promote the organization.

Shiism's striking transnational features, and general findings on European Islam, suggest prolific border-crossing and cross-ethnic organization among Shiites in Europe. Exploring British and Dutch cases, however, leaves little room for the notion of a specific European Shiite realm. When focusing on the ethnicnational background of board members of Shiite organizations and on their formal organizational interlocks, ethnically articulate identities come to the fore, particular mixes of which take shape within sub-European frameworks of states. The last section explores sociopolitical implications of Shiites' organizational life in Europe, as seen through the Dutch and British samples. A contrast is drawn between the relative scarcity of Shiite organization, which delimits the role of Shiism as a political actor in Europe, and recent indications of civic engagement.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43572622,2012,Ethnicities,10.2307_43572622

The threat / opportunity lens encompasses two conceptually distinct dimensions, gain / loss and control / limited control, which are hypothesized to produce different patterns of network interaction. Two experimental studies—one involving 158 leaders in a health-care organization and the other involving 129 employees in a range of smaller establishments—provided support for the proposed conceptualization. The studies found that (1) people chose to interact with more network contacts in situations of loss than in situations of gain, (2) those with an internal locus of control chose to interact with more network contacts in situations of limited control than in situations of control, whereas those with an external locus of control exhibited the opposite response, and (3) the tendency to interact with more network contacts in loss rather than gain was greater for low-ranking actors relative to high-ranking ones. These findings contribute to our understanding of the interplay between individual cognition and organizational social networks.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/44076830,2015,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_44076830

We trace how the once dominant imagery of ""wage slavery"" lost its connection to producerist labor ideology and eventually was replaced by the more pragmatic symbolism of ""wage work."" This linguistic shift is of particular scholarly importance because it occurred during a time when producerist labor politics, with its emphasis on a radical reorganization of work and private property, lost significant ground to a more consumerist/economistic version of labor politics. We show that this pivotal rhetorical shift was linked to changes in the cultural opportunity structure. These were, in turn, shaped through movement sector dynamics and through changes in the empirical referents which add meaning and resonance to social movement claims.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4494978,1993,Social Forces,10.2307_4494978

A number of stochastic specifications of organizational founding rates are estimated to test the effects of density dependence, resource partitioning and community interdependence on the vital dynamics of the organizational populations under study. Processes of density dependence and resource partitioning are shown to have a different impact on the founding rate of generalist and specialist organizations. The empirical analysis reveals the existence of community-level patterns of asymmetric mutualism between the two populations of banking organizations. While the proliferation of Rural Co-operative banks accelerated the founding rate of Popular Co-operative banks, the founding rate of Rural Co-operative banks was unaffected by the number of Popular Co-operative banks in existence.

Two very differently conceived lesbian and gay festival organizations, sites at which decision making about collective identity is ongoing and self-conscious, are examined. The analysis traces how each responds to two related tasks: maintaining community legitimacy, which requires racial diversification, and surviving within an altered institutional environment.

1,0,0,Symbolic Interaction and Applied Social Research: A Focus on Translational Science,"In symbolic interaction, a traditional yet unfortunate and unnecessary distinction has been made between basic and applied research. The argument has been made that basic research is intended to generate new knowledge, whereas applied research is intended to apply knowledge to the solution of practical (social and organizational) problems. I will argue that the distinction between basic and applied research in symbolic interaction is outdated and dysfunctional. The masters of symbolic interactionist thought have left us a proud legacy of shaping their scholarly thinking and inquiry in response to and in light of practical issues of the day (e.g., Park and Blumer). Current interactionist work continues this tradition in topical areas such as social justice studies. Applied research, especially in term of evaluation and needs assessment studies, can be designed to serve both basic and applied goals. Symbolic interaction provides three great resources to do this. The first is its orientation to dynamic sensitizing concepts that direct research and ask questions instead of supplying a priori and often impractical answers. The second is its orientation to qualitative methods, and appreciation for the logic of grounded theory. The third is interactionism's overall holistic approach to interfacing with the everyday life world. The primary illustrative case here is the qualitative component of the evaluation of an National Institutes of Health-funded, translational medical research program. The qualitative component has provided interactionist-inspired insights into translational research, such as examining cultural change in medical research in terms of changes in the form and content of formal and informal discourse among scientists; delineating the impact of significant symbols such as “my lab” on the social organization of science; and appreciating the essence of the self-concept “scientist” on the increasingly bureaucratic and administrative identities of medical researchers.

0,0.5,0,Comparing the Resource-Based and Market-Based Views of the Firm: Empirical Evidence from Czech Privatization,"The recent privatization of state-owned enterprises in the Czech Republic forms a natural experiment to test and compare the predictive ability of the resource-based view (RBV) against the market-based view (MBV) under conditions of great change. It has been recognized in the literature that, under normal stable circumstances, a firm's internal resources and its external market power are fundamentally intertwined. Consequently, it is difficult to identify the relative roles of these two theories in explaining expected firm performance and firm value. However, when market conditions are in a state of flux, as in the case of the Czech Republic in 1992, we expect the firm's resources to be the primary determinants of firm value. In order to test this notion, an RBV model was developed, based on a set of firm features reflecting the rare and valuable ability to compete in the emerging capitalistic economy (as opposed to the currently prevailing bureaucratically planned economy). A contrasting MBV model was also developed, highlighting the role of market power in this regard. These models were assessed in a cross-sectional sample of 988 Czech firms undergoing privatization. The empirical findings show that the RBV-driven variables are remarkably better at explaining share values of Czech firms in the period of privatization than MBV-driven variables. These results underscore the role of firm resources as a primary determinant of firm value in rapidly changing environments.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20060545,2003,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_20060545

Our hypotheses challenge assumptions in the management literature that each group will necessarily express ingroup bias and outgroup derogation. Instead, we call attention to the status hierarchy that develops from status construction processes, the prototypicality that emerges from social categorization processes, and a framework of stereotype content that is based on an analysis of structural positions among groups in the society. Using hierarchical linear modeling with survey data from scientists and engineers in research and development in 24 major corporations, we find that U.S.-born white males, who constitute the normative ingroup, receive advantages in both allocation and evaluation decisions from all evaluators, not just from other white men. We also find that normative outgroups (non-male, non-whites, and/or non-U.S. born) receive ambivalent or indifferent more than discriminatory or biased treatment, depending on their structural position in relation to U.S.-born white men, and that these effects are independent of who is doing the rating.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20109916,2007,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_20109916

We develop three claims: (1) crowding from below, which measures the number of competitors capable of surpassing a given actor in a tournament-based contest, predisposes that actor to take risks; (2) as a determinant of risky conduct, crowding from below has a stronger influence than crowding from above, which captures the opportunity to advance in rank; and (3) the effect of crowding from below is strongest after the rank ordering of the actors in a tournament becomes relatively stable, which focuses contestants' attention on proximately ranked competitors. Using panel data on NASCAR's Winston Cup Series from 1990 through 2003, we model the probability that a driver crashes his car in a race. Findings show that drivers crash their vehicles with greater frequency when their positions are increasingly at risk of displacement by their nearby, lower-ranked counterparts; the effect of crowding from below exceeds that of crowding from above; and the effect of crowding by lower-ranked contestants is greatest when there is relatively little race-to-race change in the rank ordering of drivers.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20109917,2007,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_20109917
0,0,1,Bureaucracy and Entrepreneurship: Workplace Effects on Entrepreneurial Entry,"Using a study of the relationship between bureaucratic work environments and individual rates of entrepreneurship, I revisit a fundamental premise of sociological approaches to entrepreneurship, namely, that the social context shapes the likelihood of entrepreneurial activity, above and beyond any effects of individual characteristics. Establishing such contextual effects empirically is complicated by the possibility that unobserved individual traits influence both the contexts in which people are observed and their likelihood of becoming entrepreneurs. This paper presents the first systematic study of the effects of bureaucracy on entrepreneurship that accounts for such unobserved sorting processes. Analyses of data on labor market attachments and transitions to entrepreneurship in Denmark between 1990 and 1997 show that people who work for large and old firms are less likely to become entrepreneurs, net of a host of observable individual characteristics. Moreover, there is strong evidence to suggest that this negative effect of bureaucracy does not spuriously reflect self-selection by nascent entrepreneurs into different types of firms. An important implication of this finding is that the structure of organizational populations affects the supply of nascent entrepreneurs, as well as the availability of entrepreneurial opportunities.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20109930,2007,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_20109930
0,0,1,Myopia of Selection: Does Organizational Adaptation Limit the Efficacy of Population Selection?,"This paper develops and tests a model of the effectiveness of selection processes in eliminating less fit organizations from a population when organizations are undergoing adaptive change. Stable organizational traits, such as a search strategy or routine, do not imply that an organization's performance will remain stable over time or that cross-sectional differences in performance will persist. These properties create the possibility that population-level selection processes will be inefficient in that organizations with potentially superior long-run performance will be selected out. We theorize that organizational-level adaptation often results in fluctuations in current performance across time. These fluctuations may attenuate the degree to which current performance differences among organizations are indicative of future performance. As a consequence, search strategies that generate systematically different performance trajectories, even if they share a common long-run outcome, will generate differing survival rates. These ideas are explored using a formal simulation model employing the framework of NK performance landscapes. Our central finding is that selection may be systematically prone to errors and that these selection errors are endogenous to, and differ markedly across, firms' search strategies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20109945,2007,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_20109945
0,1,0,Competing across Technology-Differentiated Channels: The Impact of Network Externalities and Switching Costs,"Technology-driven commerce channels, such as the Web, possess several unique features that differentiate them from traditional channels. The interaction between firms operating across these differentiated channels involves interesting competitive dynamics that cannot be captured by isolated models of electronic markets. This paper develops a stylized spatial differentiation model to examine the impact of differences in channel flexibility, network externalities, and switching costs on competition between online, traditional, and hybrid firms. A basic model highlighting the moderating influence of the hybrid firm on both channels is extended to account for differential network externalities and switching costs across the two channels. Our analysis indicates that while network effects as well as switching costs lead to the tipping of markets, such tipping occurs primarily due to the moderating effects of the competing channel. More importantly, with network effects an increased market share does not translate into higher profits. Contradictory to conventional wisdom, our results indicate that in a static market, consumers rather than firms, benefit from increasing network externalities, with competitive effects outweighing the surplus-extraction abilities of firms. Our results also highlight the importance of alternative revenue streams and provide insights for firms grappling with issues of channel choice as well as integration and divestiture.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20110344,2005,Management Science,10.2307_20110344

Analysis of contextual variables is not only interesting per se, but also improves the productivity test for the existence of complementarity. We use our empirical methodology to analyze complementarity between innovation activities: internal research and development (R&D) and external knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest that internal R&D and external knowledge acquisition are complementary innovation activities, but that the degree of complementarity is sensitive to other elements of the firm's strategic environment. We identify reliance on basic R&D--the importance of universities and research centers as an information source for the innovation process--as an important contextual variable affecting complementarity between internal and external innovation activities.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20110484,2006,Management Science,10.2307_20110484

Building on theory and evidence from the behavioral decision-making literature, we describe how founders' socially constructed confidence affects the manner in which they interpret information about their prior and current ventures. We then link founders' propensity to be overconfident to their decisions to allocate, use, and attain resources. In our model, founders with greater socially constructed confidence tend to deprive their ventures of resources and resourcefulness and, therefore, increase the likelihood that their ventures will fail.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20110496,2006,Management Science,10.2307_20110496

To address these questions, I assemble a novel data set that matches firms receiving a federal research and development subsidy through the U.S. Small Business Innovative Research program to VC-funded firms by observable characteristics in five technology-intensive industries. These data allow decoupling of cooperative activity resulting from start-up development via the passage of calendar time from that due to association with VCs.

0,1,0,Tainted Knowledge vs. Tempting Knowledge: People Avoid Knowledge from Internal Rivals and Seek Knowledge from External Rivals,"We compare how people react to good ideas authored by internal rivals (employees at the same organization) versus external rivals (employees at a competitor organization). We hypothesize that internal and external rivals evoke contrasting kinds of threats. Specifically, using knowledge from an internal rival is difficult because it threatens the self and its competence: It is tantamount to being a ""follower"" and losing status relative to a direct competitor. By contrast, external rivals pose a lower threat to personal status, so people are more willing to use their knowledge. We conducted three studies. Study 1 showed that internal and external rivalry involved opposite relationships between threat and knowledge valuation: The more threat internal rivals provoked, the more people avoided their knowledge, whereas the more threat external rivals provoked, the more people pursued their knowledge. Study 2 explored the types of threat that insiders and outsiders evoked. In particular, people assumed that they would lose more personal status if they used an internal rival's knowledge and, therefore, reduced their valuation of that knowledge. Finally, Study 3 found that self-affirmation attenuated these patterns. We suggest that the threats and opportunities for affirmation facing the self dictate how people respond to rivals and, ultimately, their willingness to value new ideas.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20110589,2006,Management Science,10.2307_20110589

This exposure is in turn determined by the number of banks aiming to focus on lending to an industry. In equilibrium, the industry receives funding from a limited number of banks with industry expertise, as well as from a competitive fringe of financiers without such expertise.

0,0,0,Measuring and Mitigating the Costs of Stockouts,"There is now an extensive theoretical literature investigating optimal inventory policies for retailers. Yet several recent reviews have recognized that these models are rarely applied in practice. One explanation for the paucity of practical applications is the difficulty of measuring how stockouts affect both current and future demand. In this paper, we report the findings of a large-scale field test that measures the short- and long-run opportunity cost of a stockout. The findings confirm that the adverse impact of a stockout extends to both other items in the current order as well as future orders. We show how the findings can be used to provide input to inventory planning models and illustrate how failing to account for the long-run effects of a stockout will lead to suboptimal inventory decisions. We also demonstrate how the findings can be used in a customer lifetime value model. Finally, the study investigates the effectiveness of different responses that firms can offer to mitigate the cost of stockouts. There is considerable variation in the effectiveness of these responses. Offering discounts to encourage customers to backorder rather than cancel their orders is widely used in practice, but that was the least profitable of the responses that we evaluated. The findings have important implications for retailers considering the use of discounts as a response to stockouts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20110646,2006,Management Science,10.2307_20110646
0,0,0,"Strategic Investments, Trading, and Pricing under Forecast Updating","This paper considers two independent firms that invest in resources such as capacity or inventory based on imperfect market forecasts. As time progresses and new information becomes available, the firms update their forecasts and have the option to trade their resources. The trade contract is determined as the bargaining equilibrium or, alternatively, as the price equilibrium. Assuming a fairly general form of the profit functions, we characterize the Nash equilibrium investment levels, which are first-best under the price equilibrium trade contract, but not under the bargaining equilibrium trade contract. To gain additional insights, we then focus on firms that face stochastic demand functions with constant price elasticity and have contingent pricing power. Assuming a general forecast evolution process, we characterize the impact of the option to trade and the firms' cooperation on equilibrium investments, expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus. Finally, to study the main driving forces of trading, we employ a well-established and empirically tested forecast updating model in which the forecast evolution process follows a two-dimensional geometric Brownian motion. Under this model, we prove that the equilibrium investments, expected prices, profits, and consumer surplus are nondecreasing in the quality and timing of forecast revisions, in market variability, and in foreign exchange volatility, but are nonincreasing in market correlation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20110663,2006,Management Science,10.2307_20110663
0,0,0,On the Recoverability of Choice Behaviors with Random Coefficients Choice Models in the Context of Limited Data and Unobserved Effects,"Random coefficients choice models are seeing widespread adoption in marketing research, partly because of their ability to generate household-level parameter estimates with limited data. However, the power of such models may tempt researchers to trust that they continue to produce reasonable estimates, when in fact either model misspecification or insufficient data limits the models' ability to recover household-level parameters successfully. If household-level choice behaviors are not recovered successfully, managerial decisions such as marketing-mix planning and targeting, direct marketing, segmentation, and forecasting may not produce the desired results. This study addresses the following questions. First, can random coefficients choice models correctly identify markets characterized by preference and response heterogeneity, state dependence, the use of alternative decision heuristics that result in reduced choice sets, and combinations of these effects? If so, how much data is required, and is this realistic given the size of data sets typically used in marketing analyses? Which model selection criteria should be used to identify these markets? When there is spurious market identification, which parameters contribute to the spurious result? An extensive simulation experiment is conducted wherein random coefficients logit models with varying specifications of parameter heterogeneity, state dependence effects, and choice set heterogeneity are applied to 128 experimental conditions. The results show which types of markets can be identified reliably and which cannot. Based on the results of the simulation, the authors develop a model selection heuristic that identifies the correct market in 81% of the experimental conditions. In contrast, strict application of the best model selection criterion alone results in correct market identification in at most 34% of experimental conditions. Interestingly, we find that the amount of data (number of households or number of purchases per household) does not affect our ability to identify the correct market type with this heuristic, so there is a good chance of identifying the correct market type even when little data is available.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20122362,2008,Management Science,10.2307_20122362
0,1,0,Do Bridging Ties Complement Strong Ties? An Empirical Examination of Alliance Ambidexterity,"This study examines the underexplored tensions and complementarities between bridging ties and strong ties in innovation-seeking alliances. Bridging ties span structural holes to provide innovation potential but lack integration capacity, and strong ties provide integration capacity but lack innovation potential. We theoretically develop the idea that--notwithstanding their tensions--strong ties complement bridging ties in enhancing alliance ambidexterity at the project level. While bridging ties provide access to diverse, structural hole-spanning perspectives and capabilities, strong ties help integrate them to realize an innovation. We also propose that their effects and complementarities influence alliance ambidexterity because they facilitate knowledge integration at the project level. Tests using data on 42 innovation-seeking project alliances involving a major American services conglomerate and its alliance partners support the majority of the proposed ideas. Implications for interfirm network configuration, strategic alliances, and the broader strategy literature are also discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20142016,2008,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_20142016

Finally, I show that the ability to integrate a large periphery of heterogeneous weak ties and a core of strong ties is a distinctive lead firm's relational capability, one that provides fertile ground for leading firms in knowledge-intensive alliance networks to gain competitive advantages whose sustainability is primarily based on the dynamic innovative capability resulting from leveraging a dual network architecture.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20142463,2007,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_20142463
0,1,0,Public versus Private Funding of Nonprofit Organizations: Implications for Collaboration,"The ability and inclination of nonprofit organizations to engage in collaborative service arrangements depends on the organizational incentives shaped by their financial stakeholders. We anticipate that nonprofit organizations that rely primarily on private funding will avoid the costs of collaboration and, thus, be less likely to engage in service collaborations. Based on data derived from a national survey of nonprofit organizations, we statistically estimate the effect of reliance on public and private funding sources for the organizational choice to engage in interagency service collaboration. Consistent with our expectations, we find that nonprofits mainly supported by private funding sources are less likely to collaborate than publicly funded nonprofits.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20447670,2007,Public Performance & Management Review,10.2307_20447670
0.5,0,0,Configuring Expert Knowledge: The Consultant as Sector Specialist,"This study defines an aspect of consultant knowledge that provides credibility without claiming unrealistic status for a field like consulting. Our focus is the ""sector knowledge"" that consultants accumulate which derives from repeated assignments in the industrial sector in which the client organization resides. This has been under-researched partly because of an emphasis on knowledge as technique and method. But knowledge configured around the sector enables consultants to play the role of the outside expert and draw on a language and experiences held in common with the client. The paper explores the role of consultants as sector intermediaries through a case study of contemporary management consulting in a UK local authority. We see ""the sector"" as an alternative type of knowledge formation salient for a client-centered occupation like consulting. We also explore sector knowledge as a negotiated setting and dispel overly simple notions of know-how being ""brought to"" the client.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20542519,2008,Journal of Organizational Behavior,10.2307_20542519

The study conducts input-oriented and output-oriented data envelopment analyses (DEAs) using multiple input and output variables. DEA results suggest that urban nonprofit hospitals are relatively more efficient than their rural counterparts. The results also show that smaller nonprofit hospitals are relatively more efficient than larger and medium hospitals. Interestingly, results show that small urban nonprofit hospitals are relatively more efficient than any other nonprofit hospitals. From a management and policy perspective, this study indicates that rural nonprofit hospitals and larger hospitals need to benchmark urban or smaller nonprofit hospitals to improve efficiency, possibly by downsizing the scale of the hospitals, adopting new marketing strategies, and changing the cost structure of facility operation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/PMR1530-9576340102?casa_token=GpY87RJ554wAAAAA:gEqgKdveFHGTPq5R64Orz1SCIFfhPKxQLiO2UD0FDubhfYRDQjjUSfvBTYiNyLS3cBawMVyVDYkE,2010,Public Performance & Management Review,10.2307_20779220

Their positioning towards rationality, however, is at odds with the observation of rationality persistence in organizational life. This paper addresses this paradox. It proposes a new perspective on rationality that allows the theorizing of the production of rational decisions by organizations. To account for rationality's éternel retour, we approach rational decision making as performative praxis—a set of activities that contributes to turning rational choice theory into social reality. We develop a performative praxis framework that explains how theory, actors, and tools together produce rationality within organizations through three mechanisms: rationality conventionalization, rationality engineering, and rationality commodification. This framework offers new avenues of research on rational decision making and points to the factors that underlie the manufacture of rationality in organizations.",external-fulltext-any,2011,Organization Science,10.2307_20868880

We examine a broad social network of interlocking directors in U.S. firms over a period of 17 years and consider the likelihood that these firms will adopt a strategy of expansion into China. Results show that ties to adopters that unsuccessfully implement this strategy have a nearly equal and opposing effect on the likelihood of adoption as do ties to those that successfully implement the strategy. Ties to those that do not implement the strategy also have a suppressive effect on the likelihood of adoption. Furthermore, we examine a firm's position in the core-periphery structure of the interlocking directorate, finding that ties to adopters closer to the network core positively affect the likelihood of adoption. We discuss the implications of our study for social network analysis, governance, and internationalization research.",external-fulltext-any,2011,Organization Science,10.2307_20868887

More specifically, the paper argues that while the high degree of institutional uncertainty in emerging markets often acts as a barrier to entrepreneurship, it can also provide important opportunities for entrepreneurs. We argue for the usefulness of recent work in neo-institutional theory as an approach to understanding the institutional context of emerging economies, and in particular for exploring the relationship between institutional uncertainty and entrepreneurship in emerging markets. Drawing on neo-institutional theory, the paper develops a typology of possible institutional strategies available to entrepreneurs in emerging markets. Three strategies are identified: institutional brokering, spanning institutional voids, and bridging institutional distance. The success factors associated with each strategy are also considered.

We assume that in many MNCs this interdependence has increased the need for cross-border coordination. We analyze to what extent MNCs use IHRM practices in order to enhance their coordination capability across national borders. We present a framework that addresses these effects and empirically test it using data from a questionnaire survey among 142 majority-owned overseas subsidiaries of German MNCs. The findings show that the degree of interdependence is related to the level of international experience of staff employed in subsidiaries, the use of third-country nationals, the provision of training, the use of cross-cultural management teams, and the choice of employee evaluation and reward methods. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for IHRM practitioners and scholars as well as the limitations of our study.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23012236,2011,MIR: Management International Review,10.2307_23012236

It draws on the work by Kornai and Chavance, exploring the economic reforms in Eastern Europe pre-1989 and the typical management behaviour in response to administrative changes in that time. The profile of the Socialist Management System is compared with the changes in management practices in the construction industry in Bulgaria in 1994-95. The comparative analysis includes two case studies - one state firm 'Metal Design', and one private firm 'Apolos' - representing the changes in management under the pressure of market reforms.

The research focuses on the drive, process, and outcome of downsizing with respect to labour flexibility in the two state-owned machinery manufacturing companies from the management perspective. By employing the Western downsizing approaches as developed by Cameron's (1994), empirical findings on downsizing in the two studied Chinese state firms are examined and analyzed. The research concludes that downsizing is a necessary but not sufficient policy. Massively laying off staff does not come without costs. To the contrary it generates new personnel problems such as unwanted quits and drain of human capital that are critical for the continuous business process of the downsizing firm. In dieser Arbeit wird von einer Fallstudie berichtet, die sich mit der gegenwärtigen Umstrukturierungspraxis im staatlichen Sektor in China Mitte der 90er Jahre beschäftigt.

This paper analyzes and compares the code contents of seven Eastern European countries with respect to generally accepted best practice recommendations on disclosure rules, strengthening shareholder rights and modernising boards. We show that for some countries the contents of the country codes are actually rather different as compared to these best practices, suggesting that domestic forces related to country-specific characteristics of corporate governance systems may have helped shaping the contents of corporate governance codes. Die bisherige Fachliteratur argumentiert, dass die Inhalte der Corporate Governance Kodizes relativ ähnlich sind aufgrund von externen Faktoren wie der wachsenden Integration der Länder in die globale Wirtschaft, der verstärkten Rolle von ausländischen institutionellen Investoren und den Empfehlungen für Corporate Governance — Praktiken in internationalen Organisationen. Dieser Aufsatz analysiert und vergleicht die Inhalte der Kodizes von sieben osteuropäischen Ländern im Hinblick auf allgemein akzeptierte „best practice“ — Empfehlungen bezüglich Offenlegung, Stärkung der Aktionärsrechte und der Modernisierung der Führungsgremien.

In this study, a sample of 232 Slovenian unlisted companies has been examined. The results show that less than a quarter of the companies disclose disaggregated information. Moreover, the multiple regression analysis reveals that the scope of the disclosed disaggregated information is not influenced by the company's size, financial leverage, profitability or growth, but that only a company's membership in the construction industry sector is a relevant determinant. Furthermore, additional analysis reveals that the companies' proprietary information does not influence the management practices regarding which disaggregated information to disclose.

0,1,0,Social Capital Determinants of Preferential Resource Allocation in Regional Clusters,"Regional clusters are known to facilitate firms in achieving higher levels of competitive advantage. This observation suggests that cluster firms manage to obtain better competitive resources than firms outside the cluster. The strong social ties in regional clusters are considered to be a crucial factor in the resource exchange between cluster firms. In this paper, we integrate this social perspective from the cluster literature with a recent stream in the resource-based view (RBV) literature. This stream seeks to explain the phenomenon of preferential resource allocation. That is, how can firms obtain better resources from a resource environment that is shared with competitors? Although preferential resource allocation has revealed to be a relevant concept, little is known about its actual antecedents. We introduce a conceptual framework that builds on the social interactions among cluster firms to explain the concept of preferential resource allocation. More specifically, we develop propositions on the antecedents of preferential resource allocation by building on the structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital theory, and a firm's embeddedness in a regional cluster. In so doing, this paper provides insights that may contribute to a better understanding of the competitive advantage of cluster firms, and it opens onto current streams in the RBV literature.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23610636,2013,Management Revue,10.2307_23610636

Relational and positional embeddedness in the making of financial capital,"This study explores the mechanisms through which relational embeddedness affects the performance of banks in syndication networks formed in the Canadian investment banking industry. I argue that banks have a choice between building embedded network ties that are overlaid with social context and arm's-length ties that facilitate individual competition. Contrary to the arguments advanced in previous studies, I propose that maintaining a mix of arm's-length and embedded relationships represents a disadvantageous network strategy. Such strategy not only simultaneously exposes investment banks to competition from their peers, relying primarily upon embedded or arm's-length ties, but also sends confusing signals about banks' networking behavior I also propose that the link between relational embeddedness and performance is moderated by banks' positional embeddedness, reflected in their status, and find that banks of higher status extract greater benefits from maintaining embedded ties, as compared with banks of lower status.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23727403,2005,Strategic Organization,10.2307_23727403

The horizontal dimension of institutionalization of subunit power causes inertia, while the vertical dimension of power differences in the top management team causes strategic change.

Network ties embedded within social relationships influence economic actions and represent a strategic form of organizing for emerging entrepreneurial firms. Research questions include the following (1) What are the components of the social relationships of relationally-embedded ties? (2) How can relationally-embedded network ties be classified to identify different types of embeddedness based on variations in the social relationships? (3) What strategic implications can be drawn from a multidimensional view of relational embeddedness? This study uses case study methods to examine external network ties of eight emerging firms in the computer industry. A classification typology of seven types of relational embeddedness emerges based upon combinations of three overarching social components - personal relationship, dyadic economic interaction, and social capital. The typology suggests multidimensionality of both embeddedness type and intensity.

Two distinct features of social relations have been examined extensively: their strength and structure. Their effects on knowledge transfer remain unclear, however, and researchers have attended to one or the other of two constraints â€“ information loss and transfer cost â€“ in efforts to elucidate them. Yet, few studies analyse the joint effects of these constraints on knowledge transfer in a network directly. To examine their interaction, this article develops an agent-based simulation and experiment with four different kinds of relations: a sparse network with weak ties, a sparse network with strong ties, a dense network with weak ties and a dense network with strong ties. At the individual level, the study finds that dense networks comprised of weak ties afford more valuable knowledge if information loss is trivial and the cost of initiating ties is larger than the cost of transfer, but that the value of density declines rapidly as information loss increases. At the organizational level, in contrast, sparse networks with strong ties appear optimal for knowledge transfer via social relations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23728577,2008,Strategic Organization,10.2307_23728577
0,0,0,The important dimensions of wine tourism experience from potential visitors' perception,"The objective of this study is to identify the salient features of wineries and wine regions, from the perspective of a potential Israeli visitor. This insight facilitates an understanding of the features that might influence the decision to visit a winery or wine region, and enables operators to develop varied wine tourism products, combined with other attractions and activities. An exploratory study has been conducted and included 373 valid questionnaires of adult Israeli residents. The questionnaires included a list of 42 winery and wine region features, based on previous literature and preliminary semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked to rate the importance of each feature with respect to their decision to visit wineries or wine regions (on a 1—5 Likert-type scale). Factor analysis technique was implemented resulting in three factors, representing different dimensions of the wine tourism experience, and explained 43.9 per cent of the total variance. Factor scores were calculated and used for comparisons between different segments. The findings indicated that different segments yielded different importance ratings for each dimension. Fundamental differences occurred among specific segment bases: winery visitation frequency, subjects having children less than 18 years and wine involvement. Results show that the motivations for choosing a wine region as a tourist destination go beyond a simple desire to experience wine. A tourist's decision to visit a specific winery is also shaped by the willingness to experience the region's features and to participate in other activities or attractions during the visit.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23745328,2009,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23745328

Much of the work on diversity management (DM) has, however, been done in the developed world. With this background in mind, this research set out to analyse Zimbabwean hotel managers' perspectives on workforce diversity, and DM practices in Zimbabwe's hotel industry. Data were collected through an interview survey with 38 human resource managers in 38 hotels located in various towns around Zimbabwe. It was found that most managers accept and tolerate rather than value diversity. The findings also suggest that human resource practices in the industry are still based on the traditional concepts such as Equal Opportunities and Non-discrimination.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23745401,2010,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23745401

Whereas the media often depicts foreign cultures in a stereotypical manner, the opportunity exists in the hospitality field to offer consumers a more detailed and accurate insight into a culture. Yet, is this what consumers really want? This paper addresses an important question: How do spaces of consumption affect the perception and representation of 'authentic' culture? To explore this, a four-stage, cross-cultural (ie Australia and United States) qualitative study was undertaken to examine the role the Outback Steakhouse chain of restaurants plays in representing Australian culture in the United States. Findings revealed that US subjects were more accepting of the restaurant environment where it matched the images of Australia perpetuated by the media. By contrast, Australian subjects indicated that the image this restaurant provides is a largely stereotypical, outdated, inaccurate representation of their culture.

Six core STP literacies (technical, analytical, ecological, multi-cultural, ethical, policy and political) are identified, which guide skill and knowledge development for the sustainability practitioner. These are facilitated through experiential education in the field that facilitates critical thinking, practical knowledge and participatory action. It is argued that a critical reflexive stance combined with a collaborative community service-learning approach in STP enables phronesis (practical wisdom) and praxis (social change). A case example is provided of an academic-community collaboration involving undergraduate students, local public and private sector stakeholders, plus diverse rural residents that came together temporarily to explore a cultural heritage issue and challenge. This collaboration facilitated collaborative learning, diverse community involvement and community service. The case overview illustrates a teaching opportunity that conveys how some of these STP priorities were undertaken, including the need for critical social action (to address not only environmental issues but also social-cultural sustainability issues related to the well-being of minority, marginalized and diverse populations).",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23745474,2011,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23745474
0,0.5,0,Thompson's Assessment of Organizations: Universities and the AAUP Salary Grades,"This paper explores Thompson's theory of organizational assessment as it pertains to the organizations's use of social reference groups. Because certain organizations, such as universities, have ambiguous goals and because the organization's decision makers are faced with unclear means to attain these goals, the organization must rely on measures of relative performance using other similar organizations as the standard of assessment. The behavior of salaries in 652 colleges and universities over a 10 year period relative to the published AAUP scales is analyzed using four hypotheses developed from Thompson concerning the use of other organizations as reference groups in measuring organizational performance.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392125,1971,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392125

The study investigates the relationship over time of rule changes at the Chicago Board of Trade to uncertainty in commodity futures prices and to volume of futures transactions in a period of 84 months. The findings support the proposition that the transformation of working rules is partly associated with the level of uncertainty in the exchange environment.,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392301,1975,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392301

Five basic elements are set forth in Weber's work which must be included in any research perspective that seeks to deal with organizational power: (1) the sources of pressure to use external power strategies; (2) the strategies available for gaining power over the environment; (3) the mechanisms shaping the decisions of administrators to actually use potential power; (4) implications of the model of organizational behavior for the dynamics of its political control; and (5) a research methodology appropriate for examining variation in the concrete dynamics of organizational domination. The comparative structural analysis of Blau, and the political perspectives of Selznick, Zald, Benson, and the institutional economists are analyzed in light of Weber's five key elements, to see how well these research traditions allow us to uncover the dynamics of organizational power.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392434,1972,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392434

Data on the interlocking directorates of 1094 large U.S. corporations in 1962, 1964, and 1966 are analyzed with a test-retest simultaneous equation model. The results confirm the common, but little tested, assumptions that centrality measures are highly reliable and stable. Further, we find that, of three measures examined (number of interlocks, nondirectional centrality, and directional centrality), number of interlocks is slightly more reliable or stable than the other two. Finally, the results show that the centrality of banks is more stable than the centrality of nonbanks. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these findings.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392531,1977,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392531

Individuals who had filed complaints of unfair employment discrimination completed questionnaires about the organizational retaliation that followed their whistle-blowing.

The interactions of the opportunity structure generated by the formation of new organizations and individual marketability explained mobility and job satisfaction for the 20 years studied. Cross-sectional relationships differed markedly at the three times; therefore, generalizations based upon one set of time-bound circumstances do not hold at another time.

Data on detected violations of rules of athletic recruitment and practice from 1952-1972 were drawn from published records of the NCAA. Competitive relationships affect the monitoring and punishment of rule violations. Competitively strong institutions are more likely to be detected and penalized for violations than are weaker ones. Level of competition and changes in performance are also related to the probability of being penalized. The severity of penalties is not closely related to the nature of rule violations but penalties may be lighter for institutions which are less dependent upon the association. Implications for the current problems of government regulatory agents are drawn from the results.,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392597,1972,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392597

We show that both internal population dynamics and events external to the press account for the quasi-cyclical patterns of newspaper foundings. Prior demises and prior foundings of newspapers both have curvilinear effects on current foundings; however, political turbulence at the national level accounts for the launching of most new press ventures. Institutional regime changes and economic cycles appear to have no effect on newspaper foundings.

The methodological approach, based on a network analysis of multiple organizational relations in a population of voluntary social service organizations, operationalizes the collective strategy typology and links homogeneity among organizations to their location in the organizational field. The results of the investigation offer strongest support for a strategic choice perspective and suggest that the environment is not highly deterministic in shaping organizational characteristics.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392643,1984,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392643

Data for the study were gathered on a large university system's budgeting process both through extensive archival documents that included working papers, internal memoranda, newspaper coverage, and formal budget submissions and through in-depth interviews with key budgetary actors. The paper shows how specific individuals in both the organization and the larger social context actively invent and then articulate institutionalized expectations regarding organizational policies and procedures. These expectations are quite specific, procedural, and enforceable. This study also shows that the process of institutionalization appears to be infused with power and self-interest both within the organization and in extraorganizational relations, with extraorganizational relations appearing to play a dominant role in periods of organizational decline.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392644,1983,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392644

Private control, larger departmental size, and a greater tendency to work alone were all associated with more dispersed wages; more social contact among departmental members, more democratic and participative departmental governance, and more demographic homogeneity were associated with more equal salary distributions. The results are consistent with social psychological theories of reward allocation that have emphasized the importance of norms, social contact, and social relations as critical factors in the allocation process.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392645,1983,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392645

The results from this study suggest that the development of termination policies and benefits-transition assistance, severance pay, and advance notification-for salaried and hourly workers can best be understood as a complex interplay between (1) the economic and organizational requirements for employee productivity and commitment, (2) organizational scale and market concentration, and (3) political and institutional pressures for normatively prescribed employment practices.

Because empirical observations are inevitably mediated by theoretical preconceptions, our knowledge of organizations is fundamentally shaped by the subjective world views through which we perceive data. Truth is defined in terms of the theoretical constructs and conceptual vocabulary that guide research and mediate access to organizational phenomena. The chief product of research is, consequently, theoretical language, rather than objective data. The knowledge of administrative science is not built from objective truths but is, instead, an artifact-the product of social definition. Institutional mechanisms reinforce these social definitions of truth by investing them with the stamp of scientific authenticity.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392694,1971,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392694

After this early ""honeymoon"" period, the rate at which relationships ended decreased with time, consistent with notions that assets specific to the relationship develop over time. Furthermore, we found that relationships in which the task was more complex tended to be of longer duration.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392713,1981,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392713

This article examines the effect of the proportion of women administrators on the salaries of both men and women in administrative positions in colleges and universities. Four theoretical perspectives that make predictions about the effect of the proportion of women are identified: economic competition and crowding, demographic group power, group interaction, and institutionalization. The results indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the proportion of women and the salaries of both men and women. This relationship holds both cross sectionally and longitudinally, and the effect is not completely linear. These results are inconsistent with both the demographic-group-power and group-interaction perspectives and provide some support for both the economic competition and institutionalization approaches.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392740,1983,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392740
1,0,1,Industrial Relations and Firm Behavior: Informal Labor Practices in the West Coast Longshore Industry,"The industrial relations policies and practices of stevedore firms in the West Coast longshore industry are considered in terms of three theories - the social-control, worker-resource, and institutionalist theories. Firm behavior was assessed by examining how leniently companies interpreted and enforced their coastwide collective bargaining agreement with longshore workers and how actively they competed for the services of the most skilled workers, the crane operators. Significant differences in behavior were observed between firms that were subsidiaries of large steamship lines and firms that were independent operators. The former were more lenient in contract interpretation and more competitive in recruitment than were the latter. These findings supported the worker-resource theory - workers and union officials took advantage of the subsidiaries' insulation from market competition to bargain for extracontractual benefits that the independents were unable to provide. Some implications for theory and research are drawn from the findings.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392742,1976,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392742
1,0,0,Technology as an Occasion for Structuring: Evidence from Observations of CT Scanners and the Social Order of Radiology Departments,"New medical imaging devices, such as the CT scanner, have begun to challenge traditional role relations among radiologists and radiological technologists. Under some conditions, these technologies may actually alter the organizational and occupational structure of radiological work. However, current theories of technology and organizational form are insensitive to the potential number of structural variations implicit in role-based change. This paper expands recent sociological thought on the link between institution and action to outline a theory of how technology might occasion different organizational structures by altering institutionalized roles and patterns of interaction. In so doing, technology is treated as a social rather than a physical object, and structure is conceptualized as a process rather than an entity. The implications of the theory are illustrated by showing how identical CT scanners occasioned similar structuring processes in two radiology departments and yet led to divergent forms of organization. The data suggest that to understand how technologies alter organizational structures researchers may need to integrate the study of social action and the study of social form.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392767,1979,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392767

The findings show more support for the external legitimacy than for the internal coordination argument. Indicators show that forms of external legitimacy - the acquisition of a Community Directory listing, the acquisition of a Charitable Registration Number, and board size at birth - all significantly depress organizational death rates, whereas most internal organizational changes are unrelated to death rates. The exception is chief executive change, which lowers death rates, suggesting that chief executive turnover may be adaptive. The lack of institutional support experienced by young organizations is one important reason underlying the liability of newness in organizations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392787,1983,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392787

Prior research was used to guide selection of the four major constructs studied: domain initiative, environmental carrying capacity, slack, and performance. What emerges is a clear portrayal of a protracted process of decline, aptly portrayed by prior theorists, and modeled here, as a downward spiral. In the firms studied, significant features of the downward spiral included early weaknesses in slack and performance, extreme and vacillating strategic actions, and abrupt environmental decline. An elaboration of the last two stages of decline is also presented, based on the findings from this study. The down-ward-spiral model is then illustrated with a case example. The study sheds light on major debates and dilemmas in the fields of organization theory and strategy regarding why major firms fail.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392853,1985,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392853

Results indicate that traditional theories of group effectiveness match the implicit theories of team members. These theories account for 90 percent of the variance in team satisfaction and self-reported effectiveness but none of the variance in the teams' sales performance.

0,1,0,Enacting Market Crisis: The Social Construction of a Speculative Bubble,"This study shows how the emotional phases that accompany market crisis can be related to an underlying cycle of actions, attributions, and regulatory reactions among participants in the market environment. The action-attribution-regulation process is here called ""enactment,"" in order to focus on how market participants create the environment that then impinges on their activity. We illustrate this process with a case study of the 1980 crisis in the silver futures market, when prices soared from 10 per ounce to 50 per ounce and fell back to 10 per ounce in seven months. The traditional mania/distress/panic model of speculative bubbles is reframed as a cycle of organizing, focusing on the strategic actions of buyers, sellers, bankers, and government agencies. The paper shows how the crisis, enacted by market participants who created speculative opportunities, was resolved through the cooperation of powerful organizations that sought to protect the solvency of insiders and the integrity of the market. This view of market process suggests a cycle of action and institutional constraint that shapes the structure of market environments.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393054,1986,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393054

Both turnover and structural change in the top positions were found to depend on firm performance and industry structure; turnover also depended on firm size and the structure of the positions, and structural change also depended on board structure, controlling for retirements. The results highlight the power of the CEO, the tendency to consolidate the top positions under the CEO, and the greater accountability of the person in the combined position for firm performance. The paper concludes with some implications of the findings for understanding the CEO and board chair positions, with an emphasis on top-management power, makes recommendations for research on turnover, and provides suggestions for corporate behavior, based on the results of this study.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393056,1984,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393056

The perspectives adopt different levels of analysis and produce contrasting views of the characteristic mode and tempo of organizational evolution. Population ecology limits investigation to evolutionary change unfolding within established populations, emphasizing factors that homogenize organizational forms and maintain population stability. Population ecology thus fails to explain how populations originate in the first place or how evolutionary change occurs through the proliferation of heterogeneous organizational types. Community ecology overcomes these limitations: it focuses on the rise and fall of populations as basic units of evolutionary change, simultaneously explaining forces that produce homogeneity and stability within populations and heterogeneity between them.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393106,1975,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393106

The circulation of power emphasizes the internal contests for control and opposition to the CEO that emerge with increased executive tenure and under conditions of economic adversity. The study finds support for an increasing rate of CEO succession during the first decade of tenure, consistent with the model of circulation, followed by a slow decline afterward, consistent with institutionalization. The effects of economic adversity were found to trigger circulation when combined with long prior board tenure and large board size. Also, contrary to conventional views, under economic adversity, more inside board members increase CEO succession.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393237,1993,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393237

The model includes the following variables: entry rate and exit rate of workers, growth rate of the organization, selectiveness of organizational recruiting, intensity of socialization (by managers and by coworkers), and the rate at which socialization decays if not reinforced. Findings from a computer simulation of the model show that cultural systems in organizations are highly robust and reach equilibrium even with high turnover and rapid growth. We also find that culture is stronger during decline than growth. Moreover, some alleged behavioral effects of culture might be explained by demographic processes rather than by psychological reactions to cultural content. In general, the model provides insights into the tradeoffs involved in cultural management.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393274,1989,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393274

In a sample of 100 organizations in the computer, chemical, and natural-gas distribution industries, executive-team tenure was found to have a significant effect on strategy and performance, with long-tenured managerial teams following more persistent strategies, strategies that conformed to central tendencies of the industry, and exhibiting performance that closely adhered to industry averages. Consistent with the theory, results differed depending on the level of managerial discretion, with the strongest results occurring in contexts that allowed managers high discretion.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393314,1979,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393314

The analysis shows that the three generic forms are distinguished by different coordinating and control mechanisms and by different abilities to adapt to disturbances. Also, each generic form is supported and defined by a distinctive type of contract law. The cost-effective choice of organization form is shown to vary systematically with the attributes of transactions. The paper unifies two hitherto disjunct areas of institutional economics-the institutional environment and the institutions of governance-by treating the institutional environment as a locus of parameters, changes in which parameters bring about shifts in the comparative costs of governance.

These arguments were tested in a network analytic study of men's and women's interaction patterns in an advertising firm. Men were more likely to form homophilous ties across multiple networks and to have stronger homophilous ties, while women evidenced a differentiated network pattern in which they obtained social support and friendship from women and instrumental access through network ties to men. Although centrality in organization-wide networks did not vary by sex once controls were instituted, relative to women, men appeared to reap greater network returns from similar individual and positional resources, as well as from homophilous relationships.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393451,1983,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393451

We used semistructured interviews with 38 new-product team managers in high-technology companies, log data from two of these teams, and questionnaires completed by members of a different set of 45 new-product teams to generate and test hypotheses about teams' external activities. Results indicate that teams engage in vertical communications aimed at molding the views of top management, horizontal communication aimed at coordinating work and obtaining feedback, and horizontal communication aimed at general scanning of the technical and market environment. Organizational teams appear to develop distinct strategies toward their environment: some specialize in particular external activities, some remain isolated from the external environment, and others engage in multiple external activities. The paper shows that the type of external communication teams engage in, not just the amount, determines performance. Over time, teams following a comprehensive strategy enter positive cycles of external activity, internal processes, and performance that enable long-term team success.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393475,1990,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393475
0,0,1,Fading Memories: A Process Theory of Strategic Business Exit in Dynamic Environments,This comparative study of the evolution of Intel Corporation's strategic position in two semiconductor memory businesses and in the microprocessor business provides insight into the forces that drive strategic business exit in dynamic environments. Inertial forces caused Intel's distinctive competence to diverge from the evolving basis of competitive advantage in the memory business. Inertial forces also caused Intel's corporate strategy to diverge from strategic actions taken by middle-level managers. Intel's internal selection environment played a key role in the strategic business exit process by causing it to shift the allocation of scarce manufacturing resources from the memory business to the emerging microprocessor business before corporate strategy was officially changed. The paper contributes to the development of theory about the role of strategy in firm evolution by offering insight into how the internal selection environment mediates the coevolution of industry-level sources of competitive advantage and firm-level sources of distinctive competence and into the link between corporate strategy and strategic action.,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393493,1984,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393493
0,0,1,Architectural Innovation: The Reconfiguration of Existing Product Technologies and the Failure of Established Firms,"This paper demonstrates that the traditional categorization of innovation as either incremental or radical is incomplete and potentially misleading and does not account for the sometimes disastrous effects on industry incumbents of seemingly minor improvements in technological products. We examine such innovations more closely and, distinguishing between the components of a product and the ways they are integrated into the system that is the product ""architecture,"" define them as innovations that change the architecture of a product without changing its components. We show that architectural innovations destroy the usefulness of the architectural knowledge of established firms, and that since architectural knowledge tends to become embedded in the structure and information-processing procedures of established organizations, this destruction is difficult for firms to recognize and hard to correct. Architectural innovation therefore presents established organizations with subtle challenges that may have significant competitive implications. We illustrate the concept's explanatory force through an empirical study of the semiconductor photolithographic alignment equipment industry, which has experienced a number of architectural innovations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393549,1979,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393549

The relationships of other organizational characteristics to the R&D procurement decision are also considered. Hypotheses are tested with data on 92 biotechnology R&D projects that major pharmaceutical companies have sponsored either in-house or through external contractual arrangements. The results suggest that small-numbers-bargaining problems motivate firms to internalize R&D. Evidence is also found that a firm's R&D experience, its dependence on the pharmaceutical business, and its national origin affect R&D procurement decisions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393554,1985,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393554

Results show that organizational commitment is highly dependent on perceived opportunities for career advancements and the criteria used in the distribution of rewards. Few of the structural characteristics are important in explaining professional commitment, and lawyers working in nonprofessional organizations are significantly less committed to the legal profession than those working in professional organizations.

Using a multiyear sample of firms in the branded foods and computer industries, we find that executives' intraindustry ties are related to strategic conformity, that extraindustry ties are associated with the adoption of deviant strategies, and that alignment of executives' external ties with the informational requirements of the firm's strategy enhances organizational performance. Our results also show that a unique or differentiated strategy is not universally advantageous and that the benefits accruing from strategic conformity are especially strong in the more uncertain computer industry.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393653,1987,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393653

Analysis of original survey data on 114 multinational firms headquartered in the U.S. and Japan and 40 domestic companies operating in Thailand shows ambiguous market incentives to firms and no impact of national values on the employment of women.

The attempt to explain what happened to ""brainwashed"" American prisoners of war in the Korean conflict points up the need to take both individual traits and culture into account to understand organizational phenomena. For example, the failure of organizational learning can be understood more readily by examining the typical responses to change by members of several broad occupational cultures in an organization.

Measures of departmental power in a university are found to be significantly related to the proportion of the budget received, even after statistically controlling for such universalistic bases of allocation as work load of the department, national rank, and number of faculty. Subunit power in the organization is also related to the correlation between a subunit's resources--budget and instructional staffs--and work load over time. The more powerful the department, the less the allocated resources are a function of departmental work load and student demand for course offerings. Subunit power is measured by both interviews of department heads and the analysis of archival records of departmental representation on major university committees. Intercorrelations between these measures of subunit power indicate that it is possible to obtain unobtrusive measures of organizational political systems without direct interviewing.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393885,1971,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393885

For this, the GLOBE (Global Leadership and Organization Behaviour Effectiveness) study was utilized as an empirical base. The results obtained from the research - generated via a factor analysis — have proved that implicit leadership theories do indeed exist and can be specifically defined; and these leadership factors differ from the international sample of implicit leadership theories. As a universal, a charismatic form of leadership behaviour is accepted in the Slovak organizational environment as being most effective; while as regards being culture-specific, it is proven that certain characteristics of leadership behaviours are more common in Central-Eastern-European countries — especially regarding of leadership factors in Slovak and Hungarian environments. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die Identifizierung der Führungsdimensionen im Slowakischen Organisationsumfeld.

First, the presence of FMNEs as a whole is likely to have a negative impact on indigenous firms' domestic sales but a simultaneous positive impact on their exports in an emerging economy like China. Second, the presence of MNEs from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (HMT MNEs) is more likely to generate this pattern of impact than MNEs from other countries (Other FMNEs). The foreign direct investment-led export strategy contributed to the dominance of the scenario described by the first hypothesis in China, while a higher degree of market commonality and resource similarity of HMT MNEs with that of indigenous Chinese firms than Other FMNEs leads to the second hypothesis. These novel hypotheses are tested and supported by a very large and recent firm-level panel dataset from Chinese manufacturing.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24570531,2014,MIR: Management International Review,10.2307_24570531

First, small firms are more willing to fluctuate their output As a result second, small firms can trade cost inefficiency with volume flexibility to increase their profits, third, output flexibility is a more viable source of competitive advantage in volatile and capital-intensive industries, and less viable in profitable industries. Indeed, the empirical analysis of over 3000 companies representing 83 industries during the 1979-87 time period supports our theoretical perspectives.

The data, collected from 40 pairs of manufacturing firms selected from as many industries over a 3-year period, shows that the size of outside institutional stockholdings has a significant effect on the firm's capital structure. We have also found that family and inside institutional owners' shareholdings moderate the relationship between outside institutional shareholdings and capital structure. Likewise, corporate executives' shareholdings supplement the relationship between outside institutional shareholdings and firms' performance.

Also, greater interdivisional coordination is required to pursue strategies which exploit R&D undertaken in diverse but complementary fields, that is, strategies aimed at broadening technological capabilities. Conversely, less interdivisional coordination is required for more specialized R&D, that is, for strategies aimed at deepening existing capabilities.

Extending this view and emphasizing the role of the central office of a multidivisional firm to transfer administrative skills, Williamson (1975) argues that competition among business units within the firm mimics a competitive capital market and leads to an efficient allocation of resources. Coase (1937), however, argues that firm size is limited by the costs of organizing diverse transactions and Chandler (1991) claims that growth is constrained by the technical and marketing expertise of the top managers. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the scope of the multidivisional firm is limited by the transferability of firm-specific skills and the efficiency of capital markets.

0,0,1,Top Executive Commitment to the Status Quo: Some Tests of Its Determinants,"Some top executives are more committed to the status quo-particularly to their organization's current strategy and leadership profile-than are others. Most empirical research on upper echelons treats psychological phenomena as a `black box'-the unobserved intervening mechanisms-that causes associations between more observable executive characteristics and organizational outcomes. In contrast, this paper attempts to directly examine the determinants of an important element of an executive's psychological orientation-commitment to the status quo (CSQ). We focus on a select set of variables which have been posited in prior research as determinants of executive CSQ, but which have not been directly tested for such a relationship. Based on a large-scale survey methodology, results suggest that an executive's tenure in an industry is a pronounced determinant of CSQ, and has significantly more impact than organizational tenure. As expected, the firm's current performance was found to be positively related to CSQ; this relationship was stronger in high-discretion than in low-discretion industries. Finally, the project reaffirms a well known human tendency: incumbent CEOs tend to believe that their eventual successors should be just like them.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486752,1980,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_2486752

The agency literature suggests that outside directors on the board provide important monitoring functions in an attempt to resolve, or at least mitigate, agency conflicts between management and shareholders. The agency literature indicates that other mechanisms such as managerial equity ownership, dividend payments, and debt leverage also serve as important devices in reducing agency conflicts in firms. This study argues and documents that an inverse relationship exists between the proportion of external members on the board and managerial stock ownership, dividend payout, and debt leverage. This is consistent with the hypothesis that individual firms choose an optimal board composition depending upon alternative mechanisms employed by the firm to control agency conflicts. Board composition is also found to be systematically related to a number of other variables including institutional holdings, growth, volatility, and CEO tenure.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2487897,1989,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_2487897

Yet, the concept of integration is ill-defined in the literature, and the impact of achieving high levels of integration is not well understood. The present paper addresses these issues. Drawing on the literature of several fields, this paper proposes the concept of organizational integration (OI), which is defined as the extent to which distinct and interdependent organizational components constitute a unified whole. Six types of OI are identified: two intraorganizational OI (internal-operational, internal-functional) and four interorganizational OI (external-operational-forward, external-operational-backward, external-operational-lateral, and external-functional). This paper then presents a model and develops 14 propositions to predict (1) the effort needed to implement different types of OI, (2) the impact different types of OI will have on organizational performance, and (3) how six factors (interdependence, barriers to OI, mechanisms for achieving OI, environmental turbulence, complexity reduction mechanisms, and organizational configurations) influence the relationship between OI types, implementation effort, and organizational performance.

While economists and sociologists have explained the location of industry clusters on the basis of unevenly distributed resources, and historians have provided rich descriptive insight into the developmental dynamics of particular metropolitan regions, little systematic theory has been advanced to explain cross-regional inflows and outflows of resources, especially with respect to patterns in cluster development. This paper examines the concept of regional industrial identity as a social code that (1) arises from the shared understandings of residents and external audiences about the suitability of a region for particular kinds of business activity and (2) influences decisions about where to locate investments. We argue that such understandings are principally informed by configurations of industry clusters that have already formed in a region. Clusters, which are the results of historical investments, are also important signals about the types of business that can thrive in the future. We develop theoretical propositions linking characteristics of regional industry cluster configurations, in particular cluster dominance and cluster interrelatedness, to the strength and focus of regional identity and, as a result, to the types and amounts of resources that will develop within and flow into and out of regions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25145975,2005,Organization Science,10.2307_25145975

Based on a detailed analysis of foreign banks in Shanghai, findings are presented that suggest that the likelihood of moving from the organizing phase to the operational stages is nonmonotonically dependent on the length of the waiting time. We found that firms seeking to gain entry into a population are negatively affected by the presence of other organizers in close geographical proximity, while the number of already-established organizations has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the aspirant's likelihood of entering a relationship that operates more broadly. After investigating the effect of the geographical location of other potential entrants, as well as the effect of relative sizes and countries of origin, we have drawn inferences about the strength of these competitors' identities and their impact on a social actor's decision to enter the population.

The focus is on two elements: the relationship between the collaboration across the two groups and their members and the members' interpretations of this relationship. Status influences the perceptions of the remote group, as well as the willingness to cooperate with its members. The key findings specify the informal closure strategies used by the high-status group in relation to the low-status group. Furthermore, the superimposition of geographic and status distance in remote work lowered the cost of exclusion of one group from the collaboration and led to the deepening of status differences between remote groups.

However, organizational size dampens the positive effect of competitive experience on the exit rate more slowly for incumbents that were large at deregulation than it does for entrants.

In elucidating these templates, we generate hypotheses about how each culture's norms influence the content and structure of employees' interactions with coworkers.

1,0,1,"""E Pluribus Unum"": Framing, Matching, and Form Emergence in U.S. Television Broadcasting, 1940-1960","Recent research holds that new organizational forms emerge from the identity of candidate organizations that enter a domain. In this study we argue that emergence of a new form, which is ultimately based on validation by external audiences, depends on two mechanisms: identity framing, i.e., how audiences perceive and frame the identity of an emerging organizational domain, and identity matching, i.e., the match between the identity of the domain and the identity of candidates. Accordingly, form emergence is best characterized as contextual rather than as an inherent attribute of the categories of candidate organizations. Using data on the U.S. commercial television industry from 1940 to 1960, we explore how entry rates of TV stations were affected by audiences' expectations about the identity of the nascent domain and by the densities of organizations with different origins. We find evidence that focused expectations expressed through public discourse about media, and the number of stations coming from radio broadcasting increased entry rates. We reconcile our findings with existing theory on the emergence of organizational forms by pointing to the joint relevance of domain-related and candidate-related identities.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25146200,2008,Organization Science,10.2307_25146200
1,0,1,"Constrained Growth: How Experience, Legitimacy, and Age Influence Risk Taking in Organizations","Poor performance indicates that an organization's routines are not well suited for its environment and prompts decision makers to search for solutions. However, results conflict regarding how this search process influences risk taking in organizations. Managers in some organizations facing actual or expected performance shortfalls tend to take risks, while managers in other poorly performing organizations avoid risky changes. This conflict is interesting because some level of risk taking appears necessary for organizations to remain competitive, adapt to their environment, and improve performance. This study examines several mechanisms that moderate risk taking following performance shortfalls. First, I draw from organizational learning theories to argue that organizations with limited operating experience are less buffered from failure, and hence that poor performance constrains risk taking at these organizations. Second, I argue that organizations with poor legitimacy are also less buffered, and hence that performance shortfalls also lead to risk aversion at these organizations. Third, I draw from structural inertia theory to suggest that older organizations are less able to support risk taking following performance shortfalls. A test of these hypotheses on the capacity expansion behavior of U.S. railroad companies generally supports these hypotheses, although the effect of age is weaker. The findings contribute to theories of organizational learning and to several perspectives in organization theory more broadly.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25146204,2008,Organization Science,10.2307_25146204
1,0.5,0,Institutional Logics or Agency Costs: The Influence of Corporate Governance Models on Business Group Restructuring in Emerging Economies,"Business groups, the leading economic players in emerging economies, have responded to the market-oriented transition primarily through corporate restructuring. Agency theory predicts that acquisition and divestiture would serve the interests of dominant families and foreign investors in different ways. Further, dominant families, foreign investors from shareholder-based countries, and foreign investors from stakeholder-based countries each operate under distinct institutional logics of appropriate restructuring strategies. We test hypotheses about agency and institutional mechanisms using large business groups in Taiwan between 1986 and 1998 as our empirical example. We find that, consistent with both mechanisms, family-controlled business groups are less likely to divest of unrelated businesses. However, the institutional logics mechanism can better explain the relative lack of unrelated acquisition in family-controlled groups and the difference in divestiture between groups with more shareholder-based foreign investment and those with more stakeholder-based investment. Our study contributes to the neo-institutional perspective of corporate restructuring and strategic management in general by empirically separating the two mechanisms and examining organizational responses to conflicting institutional logics.

In terms of diffusion, relative prices of old vs. new drugs, and intensity of detailing physicians, we find that somewhat surprisingly, the US is often ""in the middle"" relative to other countries, and is not an outlier. However, differences across classes are striking. Overall, new drug quantity elasticities with respect to own price are negative, ranging from about -0.75 to -1.1, while cross-price (new drug quantity with respect to old drug price) are positive but small.

0,1,0,Organizational Foundings in Community Context: Instruments Manufacturers and Their Interrelationship with Other Organizations,"Combining insights from organizational ecology and social network theory, we examine how the structure of relations among organizational populations affects differences in rates of foundings across geographic locales. We hypothesize that symbiotic and commensalistic interpopulation relations function as channels of information about entrepreneurial opportunities and that differing access to such information influences the founding rate. Empirical analyses of U.S. instruments manufacturers support this argument. The founding rate of instruments manufacturers rises with the densities of organizational populations that have symbiotic and commensalistic relationships with instruments manufacturers. These factors encourage the initial foundings of instruments manufacturers in areas where such organizations were not previously found. The dominance of organizational populations tied to instruments manufacturing by symbiotic or commensalistic relations increases the rate of foundings of instruments manufacturers, whereas the dominance of organizational populations that lack these relations decreases it. Finally, we find that interpopulation relationships that hinge on direct contact have less impact on initial foundings as geographic distance increases.

0,0,0,Corporate Venture Capital as a Window on New Technologies: Implications for the Performance of Corporate Investors When Acquiring Startups,"Gaining a ""window"" on new technologies is a prominent motive for corporate venture capital (CVC) investing. Recent studies suggest that information gained through CVC-related activities can improve the internal R&D productivity of established firms. This study investigates an alternative means by which information gained through CVC investing could improve firm performanceâ€”by increasing the returns to corporate investors when acquiring startups. We provide new insights based on an event study of the returns to 34 corporate investors from acquiring 242 technology startups. Consistent with predictions drawn from the absorptive capacity literature, we find that the effect of CVC investing on acquisition performance hinges critically on the strength of the acquirer's internal knowledge base: as CVC investments increase relative to an acquirer's total R&D expenditures, acquisition performance improves at a diminishing rate. We also find that firms consistently engaged in venture financing earn greater returns when acquiring startups than do firms with more sporadic patterns of investing, even controlling for firm profitability, size, and acquisition experience. These findings suggest that corporate investors systematically differ in their abilities to derive added benefits from external venturing as acquirers of entrepreneurial firms.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25614659,2009,Organization Science,10.2307_25614659

A questionnaire-based scenario study conducted on 530 management conference presenters supported the hypothesis that the decision to share a conference paper is both a calculative and normative choice. Analysis demonstrated that academicians calculate the benefits and costs of sharing within the context of dyadic exchanges, but they also follow the social norms of sharing, thereby recognizing the context of generalized exchange. In particular, academicians have more intent to share when they perceive the more general benefits of sharing and the stronger social norms of the academic community that encourage sharing. They have less intent to share when the paper type is conceptual. A subsequent examination of actual sharing behavior for two of the four initial experimental conditions generally supported our findings.

This collection of essays identified many of the key issues for future ecofeminists and asserted the core of ecofeminist thinking, that the subordination of women and the degradation of the planet were linked. Ruether explores this connection through an analysis of women's history, a critique of the sexism of the ideologies of Christian theology, classical philosophy, and psychoanalysis and a socioeconomic analysis of industrial society. Central to her ideas are the hierarchical dualisms in Western culture that divide a feminized nature from masculine culture and the apparent masculine need to seek transcendence from the bodiliness of human existence. This evaluation explores the continuing relevance of Ruether's ideas and points to some of the contradictions and dilemmas they contain. Among these are the relationship between the experiences of women in contemporary industrial society and women in other social and historical contexts, whether women have a ""special"" understanding of ecological dynamics, whether the existence of male domination rests on a discernible social base or represents a deeper aspect of the male or masculine psyche, and the motivations for, and mechanisms of achieving, a sustainable and egalitarian society.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/26161525,1997,Organization & Environment,10.2307_26161525

By contrasting the literatures on sustainability in the business and nonbusiness literatures, the authors demonstrate that in organization studies, isomorphic pressures transform the connotation of sustainability to make it consonant with a dominant corporate model. The authors argue that subservience to the institutional models implicit in the conduct of mainstream business organization traps the discipline in a self-perpetuating cycle of normative and mimetic influences, leading scholars and practitioners to mutually reinforce and sustain institutional forms compatible with their jointly held belief systems. The results of the comparative review of the literatures on sustainability is expressed in six observations suggesting a more radical posture among scholars to enable the field to achieve its full potential for critical, generative, and reflexive scholarship.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/26161558,1997,Organization & Environment,10.2307_26161558

Then, the authors empirically tested this model through seven hypotheses on how defenders, prospectors, and reactors are expected to respond to these pressures. In general, the results show that the firms' strategic orientations are predictive of their environmental responses.

In the Bhopal case, the market is largely driven by the accident itself, which severly depresses stock prices. Defensive managerial signals, in which the company denies that problems exist, attempts to lay to rest doubts about the firm's future ability to generate revenues and takes action to resume operations, tend to partially counter news of the event and to stabilize stock prices. Investors, on the other hand, react negatively to accommodative signals in which management accepts responsibility for the accident and attempts to do something to remedy the situation. The tendency of some investors to buy large quantities of Union Carbide stock in anticipation of a takeover seems to be largely responsible for a strong re-bound in stock prices that occurs within nine months of the Bhopal accident.

0,0,0,On Committee Decision Making: A Game Theoretical Approach,"In this paper, we study the committee decision making process using game theory. By a committee, we mean any group of people who have to pick one option from a given set of alternatives. A well defined voting rule is specified by which the committee arrives at a decision. Each member has a preference relation on the set of all alternatives. A new solution concept called the one-core is introduced and studied. Intuitively, the one-core consists of all maximal (for the proposer) proposals which are undominated assuming that the player who makes the proposal does not cooperate in any effort to dominate the proposal. For games with non-emtpy cores, the one-core proposals are shown to be better than the core. For games with empty cores, the one-core proposals tend to be pessimistic, i.e., they indicate the security level of the players. This is because the stability requirements of the one-core are too strong for such games. A bargaining set modeled along the lines of the Aumann-Maschler bargaining set for characteristic function games is defined for committee games. Because of its relaxed stability requirements, the bargaining set indicates more reasonable proposals than the one-core. The existence of both the one-core and the bargaining set are studied and these concepts are compared with two other well known solution concepts-the core and the Condorcet solution.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2630422,1971,Management Science,10.2307_2630422

0,0,0,"Asymmetric Information, Incentives and Intrafirm Resource Allocation","This paper considers the question: How should a firm allocate a resource among divisions when the productivity of the resource in each division is known only to the division manager? Obviously if the divisions (as represented by their managers) are indifferent among various allocations of the resource, the headquarters can simply request the division managers to reveal their private information on productivity knowing that the managers have no incentive to lie. The resource allocation problem can then be solved under complete (or at least symmetric) information. This aspect is a flaw in much of the recent literature on this topic, i.e., there is nothing in the models considered which makes divisions prefer one allocation over another. Thus, although in some cases elaborate allocation schemes are proposed and analyzed, they are really unnecessary. In the model we develop, a division can produce the same output with less managerial effort if it is allocated more resources, and effort is costly to the manager. We further assume that this effort is unobservable by the headquarters, so that it cannot infer divisional productivity from data on divisional output and managerial effort. Given these assumptions, we seek an optimal resource allocation process. Our results show that certain types of transfer pricing schemes are optimal. In particular, if there are no potentially binding capacity constraints on production of the resource, then an optimal process is for each division to choose a transfer price from a schedule announced by the headquarters. Division managers receive a fixed compensation minus the cost of the resource allocated to them at the chosen transfer price. Resources are allocated on the basis of the chosen transfer prices. If there is a potentially binding constraint on resource production, a somewhat more complicated, but similar, scheme is required.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631044,1976,Management Science,10.2307_2631044

0,0,0,A Light-Traffic Approximation for Single-Class Departure Processes from Multi-Class Queues,"This paper discusses an approximation for single-class departure processes from multi-class queues: If the arrival rate of one class upon one visit to the queue is a small proportion of the total arrival rate there, then the departure process for that class from that visit should be nearly the same as the arrival process for that class for that visit. This can be regarded as a light-traffic approximation, but only the one class must be in light traffic; the overall traffic intensity of the queue need not be low. As a consequence, in a queueing network if the routing for one class is deterministic, and if the light-traffic condition applies at every queue this class visits, then the arrival and departure processes for this class at each visit to each queue should be nearly the same as its external arrival process. This approximation is explained in terms of different time scales, and is justified here by a limit theorem in a special case. There are important implications for parametric decomposition approximation techniques: the variability parameter partially characterizing the departure process at any visit to any queue of such a low-intensity class should be nearly the same as the variability parameter partially characterizing the arrival process for that class at that visit to that queue. The approximation principle in this form was recently proposed by G. Bitran and D. Tirupati while developing improved parametric-decomposition approximations for low-variability multi-class queueing networks with deterministic routing, which have important applications in manufacturing. The approximation principle also has important implications for data networks, showing how burstiness in originated traffic can pass through heavily shared network facilities where it has relatively little effect and then reappear at the destination.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631997,1982,Management Science,10.2307_2631997
0,0,0,An Experiment in Approval Voting,"The first major experimental comparison of approval voting with regular plurality voting occurred in the 1985 annual election of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS). In approval voting a person votes for (approves of) as many candidates as desired, the winner being the candidate with the most votes. By permitting more votes than the number of positions to be filled, approval voting collects more information from the voter than does plurality voting. This can make a difference, for example, when three candidates compete for a single office. In such situations two candidates with wide but similar appeal sometimes split a majority constituency so that, under plurality voting, a minority candidate is elected. By contrast, approval voting is likely to identify the candidate who is most broadly acceptable to the electorate as a whole. In the TIMS experiment society members received an experimental approval ballot along with their official plurality ballot. Two contests involved three candidates running for a single office and a third, five candidates for two positions. Surprisingly, in two of the three contests, approval voting would have produced different winners and neither of the changes was of the type usually emphasized in the approval voting literature. The experiment demonstrated the practicality of approval voting and showed that it can elect a set of candidates different from that which plurality voting would. Direct comparison of ballots makes it possible to determine why the experimental switches occurred. It is shown that in each reversal the approval winner had broader support in the electorate than the plurality winner. The experiment also provided empirical data on how voters distribute approvals across candidates and indicated that, in this case, their behavior was roughly, but not exactly, consistent with theoretical analyses of voting efficacy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2632078,1977,Management Science,10.2307_2632078

Beyond evaluating them in an MRP context, this study extends current understanding of these two techniques by observing them in a variety of different operating environments.

Associated with the performance of each activity are two quantities: a known fixed cost and a consumption of a known amount of a scarce resource. Because the sets of activities required by the projects are not mutually exclusive, we cannot apportion an activity's fixed cost or resource consumption to a single project. In this paper, we formulate this capital budgeting problem (and a slight variant) as a maximal network flow problem with a side constraint, and we report computational experience using Lagrangian relaxation to find an optimal solution. We also discuss an application to the selection of parts and tools to include in a field repair kit used to fix a variety of types of breakdowns.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2632264,1979,Management Science,10.2307_2632264

This article expands on the results of a technical note (Goldsman and Schruben 1990) by using the theory of standardized time series to investigate weighted generalizations of Schruben's area variance estimator. We find a simple expression for the bias of the weighted area variance estimator, and we give weights which yield variance estimators with lower asymptotic bias than certain other popular estimators. We use the weighted area variance estimators to derive asymptotically valid confidence interval estimators (CIEs) for the mean of a stationary stochastic process. Although the weighted area CIEs have the same asymptotic expected value and variance of the length as Schruben's area CIE, we show that the new CIEs sometimes yield coverages which are closer to the nominal value.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2632272,1983,Management Science,10.2307_2632272

However, when the arrival process is a nonstationary Poisson process, the insensitivity property is lost. We develop a simple, effective numerical algorithm for the M<sub>t</sub>/PH/s/0 model with two service phases and a nonhomogeneous Poisson arrival process, and apply it to show that the time-dependent blocking probability with nonstationary input can be strongly influenced by the service-time distribution beyond the mean. With sinusoidal arrival rates, the peak blocking probability typically increases as the service-time distribution gets less variable. The influence of the service-time distribution, including this seemingly anomalous behavior, can be understood and predicted from the modified-offered-load and stationary-peakedness approximations, which exploit exact results for related infinite-server models.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2632837,1977,Management Science,10.2307_2632837

0,0,0,Robust Scheduling to Hedge against Processing Time Uncertainty in Single-Stage Production,"Schedulers confronted with significant processing time uncertainty often discover that a schedule which is optimal with respect to a deterministic or stochastic scheduling model yields quite poor performance when evaluated relative to the actual processing times. In these environments, the notion of schedule robustness, i.e., determining the schedule with the best worst-case performance compared to the corresponding optimal solution over all potential realizations of job processing times, is a more appropriate guide to schedule selection. In this paper, we formalize the robust scheduling concept for scheduling situations with uncertain or variable processing times. To illustrate the development of solution approaches for a robust scheduling problem, we consider a single-machine environment where the performance criterion of interest is the total flow time over all jobs. We define two measures of schedule robustness, formulate the robust scheduling problem, establish its complexity, describe properties of the optimal schedule, and present exact and heuristic solution procedures. Extensive computational results are reported to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution procedures.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2632994,1993,Management Science,10.2307_2632994

Based on team demography and organization learning ideas, we argue that CEO succession or executive team change enhances incremental organization change, while either strategic reorientation or the combination of CEO succession with executive team change triggers discontinuous organization change. We hypothesize that these contrasting intervention modes are appropriate in different contexts. A longitudinal study of the U.S. cement industry from 1918-1986 demonstrates that simple CEO succession is positively associated with subsequent performance when context is stable, but significantly more negatively associated with subsequent performance in turbulent contexts. Executive team change has significant effects on organization adaptation in both stable and turbulent contexts. Strategic reorientations are negatively associated with subsequent performance in stable contexts, but significantly more positively associated with subsequent performance in turbulent contexts. As a set, these results reinforce a demographic approach to succession research and indicate that CEO succession, executive team change, and reorientation are each distinct and important levers shaping organization adaptation.

Little attention has been given to the larger segment of most consumer goods markets in which retailers compete to sell multiple brands at the same location. This research seeks to add to the growing literature of channel competition by analyzing three channel structures, the least constrained of which deals with two competing manufacturers and two retailers, each of whom distributes both products in a noncooperative game with two Nash's and one Stackleberg equilibrium. Using differentiated products and a linear demand function, we introduce the concept of ""store substitutability""-a measure corresponding to product substitutability representing competitiveness at the retail level-between the two retailers. We are able to obtain closed form solutions for all cases. We show that the presence of competitive effects at both retail and manufacturer levels of distribution has a significant impact on profits and prices. We also study the effects of various power relationships in the channel. Furthermore, we compare these results to those obtained by previous research.

These relations are especially significant because the cost of purchased materials for an average firm is more than half its total sales. In this paper, we model the adverse incentives of a firm that sources from a competitive supplier industry. We show that a firm's propensity to behave opportunistically towards its suppliers raises the firm's input costs by decreasing the number of suppliers servicing it. This results in a suboptimal production decision compared to the firm's first best choice. We argue that an appropriate level of debt financing alters the shareholder incentives and mitigates the hold-up problem. Further, we also show that at the optimal debt level, the firm produces its first best level of output.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2634707,1975,Management Science,10.2307_2634707

It offers two main extensions of prior research. First, it operationalizes technological resources at a more detailed level than in prior studies, thereby enabling a more stringent analysis of the direction of diversification. This analysis shows that the predictive power of the ""resource-based view of the firm"" is greatly improved when resources are measured at a finer level. Second, the study integrates principles from transaction cost economics into resource-based predictions concerning diversification. In particular, it tests the common assumption that rent-generating resources are too asset specific to allow contracting. The findings point to circumstances where resources can be and are exploited through contracting rather than through diversification.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2634810,1985,Management Science,10.2307_2634810

A study that examines the first part of this process is presented. The results, based on questionnaire data from an electric utility, suggest that managers do develop a shared perception of their organization's career hierarchy. However, managers' perceptions are not unanimous, and the analysis examines two explanations for perceptual variation.

0,1,1,Adapting to a Declining Environment: Lessons from a Religious Order,"This study examines the ten U.S. provinces of the largest religious order of Catholic priests and brothers, the Jesuits, and explores the structural/organizational adaptations which these ten provinces employed to accommodate dramatic reductions in membership. The organizational placement of roughly 11,000 individual members of these provinces is traced between the years 1965 and 1979. The research indicates that, by increasing interorganizational cooperation and exchange of information and by enhancing the administrative component, these organizations were able to reduce slack resource requirements and were largely able to protect their core operations from the impact of decline. These observations differ dramatically from those reported in typical, for-profit organizations (e.g., Harrigan 1980). Finally, to the extent that cutback did reach the core, an attempt is made to examine the width and depth of retrenchment at both the divisional and departmental levels and to determine whether the mode of retrenchment affected individuals' willingness to subsequently invest in the organization. The analysis suggests that narrower, deeper cuts at the departmental level may have had a positive effect on members' willingness to invest in the organizations, while narrower, deeper cuts at the division level may have contributed to more members deciding to leave the organizations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635040,1981,Organization Science,10.2307_2635040
0,0,1,"Demographic Diversity, Conflict, and Work Group Outcomes: An Intervening Process Theory","Research has suggested that, within a work group, diversity with respect to members' demographic backgrounds can have a powerful effect on both turnover from the group and on the group's performance on cognitive tasks (i.e., ""thinking"" tasks that involve generating plans or ideas, solving problems, or making decisions). While such diversity tends to increase turnover, its effects on cognitive task performance are more mixed, sometimes enhancing performance and sometimes impairing it. An understanding of how diversity leads to these outcomes may help managers enhance work group effectiveness. Thus, in this paper I develop a theoretical model to explain the turnover and mixed performance consequences of demographic diversity in work groups. The proposed model suggests that each demographic diversity variable (e.g., diversity with respect to age, gender, race, group tenure, organization tenure, education, or functional background) can be classified according to its level of visibility and its level of job-relatedness. Visibility is the extent to which the variable is easily observed by group members, and job-relatedness is the extent to which the variable directly shapes perspectives and skills related to cognitive tasks. The model then suggests that the visibility and job-relatedness of a diversity variable indirectly influence how much turnover and/or performance enhancement the variable yields. More specifically, the visibility and job-relatedness of a diversity variable influence the levels of affective (emotional) and substantive (task) conflict in the group, and the levels affective and substantive conflict, in turn, influence the amount of turnover from the group and the group's performance. After generating six research propositions based on the model, including three addressing demographic diversity variable-conflict linkages and three addressing conflict-turnover and conflict-performance linkages, I discuss boundary conditions of the model and offer recommendations for future research.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635051,1987,Organization Science,10.2307_2635051

The authors argue that the process of technological adaptation is not gradual and continuous, as often argued in the innovation literature, but is instead highly discontinuous. Evidence from three manufacturing and service organizations indicates that there exists a relatively brief window of opportunity to explore and modify new process technology following initial implementation. Afterwards, modification of new process technologies by users is limited by the increasing routinization that occurs with experience. Thus, the technology and its context of use tend to congeal, often embedding unresolved problems into organizational practice. Subsequent changes appear to occur in an episodic manner, triggered either by discrepant events or by new discoveries on the part of users.

0,0,0,Control System and Task Environment Effects on Ethical Judgment: An Exploratory Study of Industrial Salespeople,"The objective of this research was to determine the effects of a firm's control system and dimensions of the work task environment upon ethical judgments made by salespeople. Industrial field salespeople are likely to encounter ethical conflicts on a daily basis in their dealings with customers, competitors, and their own management. How they resolve such conflicts is believed to be a function of both individual characteristics and factors in the situation. This study focuses on situational factors in the form of organization design variables, particularly control system and task environment. The firm's control system includes its method of monitoring, supervising and compensating salespeople. The study develops fourteen ethics-related selling scenarios and assesses, via projective questioning, how 446 salespeople would react to them. Findings indicate that organization design does influence the behavior a salesperson considers appropriate to cope with ethical conflicts. In particular, salespeople operating under a more bureaucratic, input-based control system advocate more ethical behavior than do salespeople operating under a more output-based, laissez-faire control system. Also, salespeople who perceive the market to be competitive recommend less ethical behavior. However, the proportion of salary versus commission in the salesperson's compensation system does not have an effect on response. Differences are also discovered with respect to the salesperson's seniority, rank, and certain features of the task environment.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635083,1988,Organization Science,10.2307_2635083

1,0,0,Comparative Cause Mapping of Organizational Cognitions,"Increasingly, thoughtful managers recognize the role of knowledge and learning in corporate action and performance. Concurrently, a new field, management and organization cognition (MOC), has emerged producing useful insights and findings. Thus far, empirical studies have largely focused on single cases or actors, using often archival data and sometimes ambiguous methods. To advance the field will require pragmatic tools for eliciting data on thinking in real organizations and for conducting rigorous and more comparative studies of management and organization cognitions. This paper describes a method for comparatively studying real-life managerial thinking, defined here as the respective manager's beliefs about key phenomena and their efficacy links in their strategic and operative situation. The applicability of such a definition will depend on the requirements of research at hand. The payoff is that, thus defined, key elements in managerial and organizational cognitions can be usefully captured by cognitive mapping, an established approach in MOC research. The approach contains, first, a method for eliciting comparison-enabling interview data of several subjects. Then, using researcher-based, interpretive standardization of the individual natural discourses, databases of standard concepts and causal links, constituting the cause map elements, are distilled. This facilitates a text-oriented description of the thinking patterns of single actors like managers or organizational groups, which can be used in traditional-type mapping studies, which typically assume unitary or quasi-unitary actors. However, the method is intended for comparative analyses, e.g., for pinpointing the cognitive differences or similarities across organizational actors or for constructing and comparing groups, assumed cognitively homogenous. Also, it is applicable for longitudinal studies or aggregated, e.g., industry-level, descriptions of MOC. A PC application is available for the technique, although many of the processing tasks are amenable to general-purpose relational database software. The paper presents a study case comparing the cognitive structures of managers in two interrelated industries in terms of their concept bases and causal beliefs. The objective was to understand the substance of management thinking, as well as the formative logic behind how managers come to think in the shared ways. It is shown that patterns of industry-typical core causal thinking, manifestations of a dominant logic or recipe, can be located, operationalized and comparatively analyzed with this method. Substantively, the contents of management thinking are typically products of complex long-term mechanisms. These consist, first, of organizational problem-solving, recurrently facing a specific, adequately stable constellation of strategic tasks and environment elements, similar within industries and systematically different across them, and, second, of various social processes, which directly transfer and influence management thinking. The paper concludes with discussing the cause mapping method and suggests some options for further studies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635134,1991,Organization Science,10.2307_2635134
0,0,0,"Executive Judgment, Organizational Congruence, and Firm Performance","Contingency theory suggests that a match among business-level strategy, organizational structure, and the competitive environment is necessary for high performance. This research asks whether manufacturing firm chief executives judge as ""good"" those strategy-structure-environment matches recommended by contingency theory. Knowledge of executive judgment is particulary important for two reasons. First, judgment-defined as an individual's understanding of relationships among objects-governs the strategic choices made by top managers. Second, prescriptive strategy theories recommend the judgments that executives ""should"" use, but there is little evidence specifically tying executive judgment to firm performance. Part of this research is essentially a ""laboratory"" study of executive judgment that was conducted in the field. Manufacturing firm chief executives' beliefs about cause-and-effect relationships among business-level strategy, structure, environment and performance were ascertained through a judgment task. The second part of the study was a field survey wherein other top executives of each firm reported on their firm's actual strategy, strategy making processes, structure, competitive environment and performance. Both the chief executives' judgments and the actual alignments were compared to the matches recommended as ""best"" by contingency theory. The hypotheses tested link the two parts of the study. Some predict relationships between judgment policies, realized alignments, and firm performance. Others attempt to identify factors that may lead to differences in executives' judgments. Results indicate that chief executive judgment is strongly related to the actual organizational alignment. Further, judgment policies that favor the strategy-structure-environment matches recommended by contingency theory produce higher performance than do other judgment policies. No support was found for either executive experience or quality of the firm's strategy making process as factors leading to executive judgment.

0,1,0,Holding Distribution Channel Relationships Together: The Role of Transaction-Specific Assets and Length of Prior Relationship,"The authors investigate the effect of managers' perceptions of two types of transaction-specific investments on their intention to terminate a current interorganizational relationship: (1) the specific knowledge necessary for a manufacturer's representative (rep) to carry out the selling function for a given manufacturer and (2) the specific knowledge reps acquire about their own customer accounts. The extent to which the length of prior relationship strengthens or weakens the hypothesized linkages is also examined. The authors test the hypotheses within the context of distribution channels (i.e., between a manufacturer and its selling agent), which are characteristic of many vertical organizational relationships. The results replicate in an additional setting some prior findings on the influence of transaction-specific investments between two parties directly involved in a relationship. The authors also find that specialized investments by a downstream partner (i.e., a manufacturer's rep) in relationships that are even farther downstream (i.e., customer accounts) can influence a manufacturer's intention to terminate the manufacturer-rep relationship. Moreover, the length of prior relationship between a manufacturer and its rep is shown to moderate this effect.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635159,1985,Organization Science,10.2307_2635159

0,0,0,"Reputation, Learning and Coordination in Distributed Decision-Making Contexts","From an organizational perspective, there are many decisions that are not strictly individual. A decision-making process may need to be distributed across multiple participants, each of whom contributes to the final decision by performing one or more tasks. A participant may be a person, a group, a team, or an artifact such as a computerized decision-support system. Computers are routinely used to support individual decision making. However, their potential for supporting distributed decision making is only beginning to be actualized. Further progress in exploring and realizing this potential can benefit greatly from a formal model that accounts for the diverse phenomena that can occur within a distributed decision maker. When considering computer-based support for distributed decision making, the issue of coordinating the multiple participants becomes the central concern. Coordination defines the structural and dynamic patterns of inter-participant relationships in an organization. It has several aspects including planning, control, and review. Planning involves task decomposition, subtask allocation and synthesis. Control indicates mediation, negotiation and execution. And review deals with performance evaluation which will then contribute to organizational learning. Moreover, coordination occurs in a context of concurrent problem-solving tasks where multiple decisions are pending simultaneously. Bits and pieces of these coordination facets have been somewhat supported by existing computer technologies, such as decision-support systems and computer-mediated communication systems. However, systematic study of such support possibilities depends on formal models of distributed decision making as organizing paradigms. In this paper, we present a model of distributed decision making that is particularly concerned with the ongoing coordination among participants in multiple simultaneously active decision processes. Basic outlines of the model are presented as an initial foundation for understanding the possibilities of computer-based support for distributed decision making. The model takes the view that an organization is dynamic in terms of its capacity for improved coordination over time and through experience. It accommodates a bidding perspective as the context for coordination. The use and adjustment of entity reputation offers a means for improved coordination over time, and for capturing the phenomenon of organizational learning.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635262,1986,Organization Science,10.2307_2635262
0,1,0,The Alliances of Spin-offs versus Start-ups: Social Ties in the Genesis of Post-Soviet Alliances,"This paper links the alliance strategy of emergent firms to the structural relations in the network of new firm organizers. Data gathered in Russia from 1991 to 1993 on nine post-Soviet commodity exchange markets demonstrate how the difference in internal social structure between spin-off and startup exchanges shapes the strategy of their inter-firm networks and initial performance. The way in which managers come together structures their diversity and openness to the outside environment. In turn, the social structure internal to the firm affects the range and scope of their ties to other organizations. I show how the high range of overlap among the ties between spin-off founders has a more concentrated connection to the outside environment than the exchanges created by more loosely-linked startup founders. The relational costs of the more concentrated ties increases the cost of search, however, it lowers the cost of malfeasance. Thus, the model suggested proposes that the relative advantage of investing in relational capital is a double-edged sword which poses constraints along with its particular advantages. Finally, the model also brings to question the relative merits of concentrated alliances supposedly advantageous to new firms in particular by suggesting that conditions of transition and institutional instability may under-cut the relative advantage of familiarity and specialization found in Western settings.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640229,1991,Organization Science,10.2307_2640229

Structural hole theory (Burt 1992) sees cohesive ties as a source of rigidity that hinders the coordination of complex organizational tasks. The two theories lead to opposite predictions on how the structure of an actor's network may affect his ability to adapt that network to a significant change in task environment. Using data from a newly created special unit within the Italian subsidiary of a multinational computer manufacturer, we show that managers with cohesive communication networks were less likely to adapt these networks to the change in coordination requirements prompted by their new assignments, which in turn jeopardized their role as facilitators of horizontal cooperation within a newly created business unit structure. We conclude with a discussion of the trade-off between the safety of cooperation within cohesive networks and the flexibility provided by networks rich in structural holes.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640283,1997,Organization Science,10.2307_2640283
0,0,0,"Change and Complementarities in the New Competitive Landscape: A European Panel Study, 1992-1996","This paper addresses three weaknesses in the literature on new organizational forms: the limited mapping of the extent of contemporary organizational change; confusion about how contemporary changes link together; and the lack of systematic testing of the performance consequences of this kind of change. Drawing on a large-scale survey of organizational innovation in European firms, the paper finds widespread but not revolutionary change in terms of organization structure, processes, and boundaries. Using the economics notion of complementarities, the paper develops contingency and configurational approaches to suggest that organizational innovations will tend to cluster in particular ways and that the performance benefits of these innovations depend on their clustering. Complementarities in performance are explored from both inductive and deductive perspectives. Consistent with the expectations of complementarity theory, high-performing firms appeared to be innovating more and differently than low-performing firms. Again consistent with complementarities, piecemeal changes-with the exception of IT-were found to deliver little performance benefit, while exploitation of the full set of innovations was associated with high performance. Though few European firms were found to exploit the complementarities of new organizational practices, those that did enjoyed high-performance premia.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640319,1992,Organization Science,10.2307_2640319

We review the history of organization theory to show that, in the past, studies of work provided an empirical foundation for theories of bureaucracy, and explain how such research became marginalized or ignored. We then discuss methodological requirements for reintegrating work studies into organization theory and indicate what the conceptual payoffs of such integration might be. These payoffs include breaking new conceptual ground, resolving theoretical puzzles, envisioning organizing processes, and revitalizing old concepts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640398,1998,Organization Science,10.2307_2640398

We test hypotheses about the complementary effects of status and reputation in an analysis of more than 10,000 affiliation decisions made by 595 wineries over a 10-year period. Results show that actors occupying high-status positions obtain greater benefit from subsequent high-status affiliations than do actors occupying low-status positions.

0,0,0,Competing for Attention in Knowledge Markets: Electronic Document Dissemination in a Management Consulting Company,"The relatively recent explosion of information available in electronic forms makes attention, rather than information, the scarce resource in organizations. In this paper, we theorize about how suppliers of electronic information compete for this resource and use data on document database use in a management consulting company to show that document suppliers that occupied a crowded segment of the firm's internal knowledge market gained less attention from employees (measured as monthly use of their database) but were able to combat this negative competitive effect by being selective and concentrated in their document supply. This result reveals a paradox of information supply in competitive information markets: the less information a supplier offered, the more it was used, because the supplier developed a reputation for quality and focus. We suggest that this view of competition for attention can also be applied to the competition among Web sites in external information markets.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2667123,1997,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2667123

This paper explores the conditions under which firms participate in this endeavor. Building on theories of how social activists inspire changes in organizational norms, beliefs, and practices, we hypothesize that shareholder actions and regulatory threats are likely to prime firms to adopt practices consistent with the aims of a broader social movement. We find empirical evidence of direct and spillover effects. In the domain of private politics, shareholder resolutions filed against a firm and others in its industry increase a firm's propensity to engage in practices consistent with the aims of the related social movement. Similarly, in the realm of public politics, threats of state regulations targeted at a firm's industry as well as regulations targeted at other industries increase the likelihood that the firm will engage in such practices. These findings extend existing theory by showing that both activist groups and government actors can spur changes in organizational practices, and that challenges mounted against a single firm or a single industry can inspire both firm and field-level changes.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27735482,2009,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_27735482

Using data on the entries of 215 U.S. public firms made into 11 Central and Eastern European transition economies during the period of 1990–2003, we find that shifts in national institutional environments, from a socialist to a market economy, reduce the extent of challenges encountered to make a hierarchical entry, which leads to an increase in foreign hierarchical entry attempts but not necessarily to a decrease in relational entry attempts as institutional transformation. We find evidence of inertial influences as experienced entrants tend to follow their previous decisions when making subsequent entry attempts. Further, they are less responsive in their foreign entry strategies to the institutional transformation in a given host country than inexperienced firms. We also find that the experience gained from relational entries results in more hierarchical entry attempts, but hierarchical entry experience results in fewer relational entry attempts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27735492,2009,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_27735492

Using data on informal exchanges among investment bankers in the equities division of a large financial services firm operating in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, and the Americas in 2001, we find that network closure in relationships in which the banker acts as an acquirer of information increases his or her performance, whereas closure in relationships in which the banker acts as a provider of information decreases it. We also find that these effects are moderated by the bankers' ability to employ alternative means (such as formal authority) to induce the cooperation of exchange partners in their acquirer role, as well as by the extent to which the bankers can benefit from being free from the control of exchange partners in their provider role. Our findings highlight the two sides of the normative control associated with network closure: control benefits people when they need to induce exchange partners to behave according to their preferences, but it hurts them when it forces them to behave according to the preferences of those partners.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27749325,2009,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_27749325

Our aim is to develop a more precise theory of the fundamental relationships among structure, performance, and environment. We find that the structure-performance relationship is unexpectedly asymmetric, in that it is better to err on the side of too much structure, and that different environmental dynamism dimensions (i.e., velocity, complexity, ambiguity, and unpredictability) have unique effects on performance. Increasing unpredictability decreases optimal structure and narrows its range from a wide to a narrow set of effective strategies. We also find that a strategy of simple rules, which combines improvisation with low-to-moderately structured rules to execute a variety of opportunities, is viable in many environments but essential in some. This sharpens the boundary condition between the strategic logics of positioning and opportunity. And juxtaposing the structural challenges of adaptation for entrepreneurial vs. established organizations, we find that entrepreneurial organizations should quickly add structure in all environments, while established organizations are better off seeking predictable environments unless they can devote sufficient attention to managing a dissipative equilibrium of structure (i.e., edge of chaos) in unpredictable environments.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27749341,2009,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_27749341

G. Dun and Company. Drawing on a repeated cross-sectional study of credit evaluations during the postbellum period (1870â€“1900), our empirical analyses suggest that organizational membership in multiple categories need not be problematic when classification systems themselves are emergent or in flux and when organizations avoid rare combinations or identities involving ambiguous components. As Dun's schema became institutionalized, boundaries between industries were more clearly defined and boundary violations became subject to increased attention and penalty by credit reporters. Our perspective highlights the utility of an evolutionary perspective and tests its implications for the salience of distinct mechanisms of hybridity.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27749343,2009,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_27749343

Our model positions cultural intelligence as a moderator that enhances the likelihood that individuals on international assignments will actively engage in the four stages of experiential learning (experience, reflect, conceptualize, experiment), which in turn leads to global leadership self-efficacy, ethnorelative attitudes toward other cultures, accurate mental models of leadership across cultures, and flexibility of leadership styles.

Never Mind: The Material Impact of Social Resources on New Venture Growth,"Although growth is a desirable outcome for new ventures due to the many advantages of large size, most new firms fail to grow, largely because of their limited resources and adaptability. This paper addresses the question of how new ventures grow despite their limited financial resources. I explore the effect of two specific nonfinancial, social resources—legitimacy and status—on new venture growth. I propose that new firms can acquire legitimacy by mimicking the structures and ceremonial activities of established firms in their industry, and can acquire status by affiliating with high-status entities. Using a unique panel data set on a cohort of advertising agencies founded in New York and Chicago between 1977 and 1985, I show that legitimacy and status have favorable impacts on new firms' growth in revenues and number of employees. The paper makes important contributions to social embeddedness and institutional research by examining the strategic implications of firm-level social resources, and to the literature on entrepreneurship in general and new venture growth in particular.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27765958,2010,Organization Science,10.2307_27765958
0,0,0,Package Size Decisions,"We describe a model examining how a firm might choose the package size and price for a product that deteriorates over time. Our model considers four factors: (1) the usable life of the product, (2) the rates at which consumers use the product, (3) the relation between package size and the variable cost of the product, and (4) the minimum quantities consumers seek to consume for each dollar they spend (we call these reservation quantities). We allow heterogeneity in the usage rates and reservation quantities for the consumers. We show that when the cost increases as a linear or convex function of the package size, the firm should make packages of the smallest possible size. Smaller packages reduce waste and allow consumers to more closely match their purchases with desired consumption. This in turn allows the firm to charge a higher unit price and also sell more unit volume. The results imply that in a market with multiple package sizes (produced by the same or competing firms), at least one of the packages must have the smallest possible size, provided the fixed cost of making the product is sufficiently low. For concave cost functions, the firm may find it optimal to make larger than smallest-size packages.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27784128,2010,Management Science,10.2307_27784128

Their divergent approaches have helped create distinct institutional environments. This study focuses on a particularly important strategic decision firms face-alliance partner selection. The study's results suggest that China's more stable and supportive institutional environment has helped Chinese firms take a longer-term view of alliance partner selection, focusing more on the potential partner's intangible assets along with technological and managerial capabilities. In contrast, the less stable Russian institutional environment has influenced Russian managers to focus more on the short term, selecting partners that provide access to financial capital and complementary capabilities so as to enhance their firms' ability to weather that nation's turbulent environment.

We argue that several ambiguities in the resource dependence model account in part for this and propose a reformulation of resource dependence theory that addresses these ambiguities, yields novel predictions and findings, and reconciles them with seemingly contradictory empirical evidence from past studies. We identify two distinct theoretical dimensions of resource dependence, power imbalance and mutual dependence, which in the original theory were combined in the construct of interdependence and yet have opposite effects on an organization's ability to reduce dependencies by absorbing sources of external constraint. Results from a study of interindustry mergers and acquisitions among U.S. public companies in the period 1985-2000 indicate that, while mutual dependence is a key driver of mergers and acquisitions, power imbalance acts as an obstacle to their formation. We conclude that our reformulation of the resource dependence model contributes to realizing the potential of resource dependency as a powerful explanation of interorganizational action.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/30037190,2005,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_30037190

In an analysis of the independent-power sector of the electricity industry from 1980 to 1992, we found that the development of regulative and cognitive institutions legitimated the entire sector and provided incentives for all sector entrants; thus, foundings of all kinds of firms multiplied rapidly but had a stronger impact on those using risky novel technologies. In contrast, the central normative institutions that developed in this sector, state-level trade associations, provided greater support for particular forms (those using established technologies) and thus increased foundings of those favored forms more than foundings of less favored forms (those using novel technologies). Our study demonstrates how institutional forces can alter the mix of organizations entering a new industry and thus contribute to diversity, as well as similarity, among organizations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/30037191,2005,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_30037191

The optimistic view is founded on the hypothesis that teams that are characterized by high network heterogeneity, whereby relationships on the team cut across salient demographic boundaries, enjoy an enhanced learning capability. We test each of these hypotheses directly and thereby avoid the problematic assumption that they contradict one another. Our analysis of data on the social networks, organizational tenure, and productivity of 224 corporate R&D teams indicates that both network variables help account for team productivity.

0,0,0,Exploring the Role of Information Technology in Organizational Downsizing: A Tale of Two American Cities,"This study explores the role information technology (IT) plays in organizational downsizing by studying two medium-sized American cities over a period of 10 years (1985-1995). Data were collected through 73 interviews, a questionnaire, and numerous documents. Four main findings emerged from the case studies. First, IT was found to facilitate organizational downsizing, but not to cause it. New City invested heavily in state-of-the-art IT over the years and more successfully downsized the organization than Old City, which lagged behind in IT investment and made no serious attempts to use IT as a tool to support strategic actions. Second, adverse environmental conditions triggered downsizing in both cities and determined the change strategies that managers used. When environmental pressures were mild (1985-1990), managers favored a convergent change strategy that resulted in limited downsizing efforts and small personnel reductions. In contrast, when environmental pressures were strong (1990-1995), managers of both cities engaged in strategic reorientation and in downsizing efforts that led to larger personnel reductions. Third, the role IT played in organizational downsizing varied according to the change strategy. IT was used to facilitate work redesign in a convergent change strategy and to facilitate more significant structural and work redesign in strategic reorientation. Fourth, more integrated and better use of IT allowed managers of New City to downsize more rationally and efficiently. It facilitated the transfer of personnel within departments, from middle management to the operations level, and across departments, from internally oriented to customer-oriented personnel. In doing so, managers of New City minimized operating costs while maintaining the same level of services. In contrast, IT in Old City did not facilitate such an agenda and managers downsized more superficially across the board, in all departments. Differences in IT consequences in the two cities are explained using the theory of slack resources in organizations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3085993,1975,Organization Science,10.2307_3085993

The diffusion perspective in institutional theory has portrayed how agents import ""ready-to-wear"" cultural accounts. In contrast, translation theory depicts how agents interpret and adapt cultural accounts as they fashion them into legitimating accounts for a local setting. An alternative would theorize accounts that are neither strictly borrowed nor idiosyncratically tailored. We advanced a third perspective, drawing on frame analysis as it is used in social movement theory. Framing theory attends to both the importance of cultural building blocks and the embedded ways in which agents relate to and shape systems of meaning and mobilize collective action to change social arrangements. We find that legitimating accounts are intertwined with the construction of social identities, which serve to legitimate, on the one hand, an account maker's participation in the discourse and set of claims, and on the other hand, the involvement of proponents and crucial audiences. We suggest that the mobilizing potential of legitimating accounts rests in part on their messages becoming ""autocommunicational,"" so that listeners identify themselves with the message.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3086073,1998,Organization Science,10.2307_3086073

In stark contrast to the tenets of strategic management, the relative inertia thesis claims that organizations are typically unable to match structural changes to their competitive environments in a timely fashion. The hypothesis is tested for the hospital industry in California during the 1980-90 time frame. Strategic movements in a competition 'landscape' are tracked using a variant of the Jaccard similarity coefficient, which has been applied in numerous studies of biological competition. Findings indicate that few hospitals are able to overcome inertial forces in adapting their service portfolios; furthermore, the ability of hospitals to strategically reposition themselves decreases markedly with provider density. Analyses also investigate the relation between organizational attributes (e.g., age, size, mission, and portfolio scope) and adaptability.

Each of these perspectives operates at a different level of analysis, respectively the transaction and the firm, and consequently differs in the primary arena of attention, namely transaction characteristics and the capabilities of firms. In making the comparison, a key distinction is made between the cost and the value aspects in the management of know-how, based on which issues pertaining to the transfer of knowledge within and across firm boundaries and the exploitation and enhancement of competitive advantage are closely examined. The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the implications of a shift in frame from cost to value in the analysis of decisions related to firm boundaries. Entry into foreign markets is used primarily as a vehicle for the accomplishment of this purpose. The paper shows how the value-based framework of the organizational capability perspective radically and fundamentally shifts the approach towards the governance of firm boundaries and argues that, even though TC/internalization theory raises some valid concerns, the organizational capability framework may be more in tune with today's business context. Some of the assumptions of the TC/internalization perspective, both direct-opportunism, exploitation of existing advantage-and indirect-preservation of the value of know-how across locational contexts, asymmetry between bounded rationality for transaction and production purposes-are critically examined and questioned. Implications of a shift from a cost to a value-based framework are discussed and the need for a shift in research focus is emphasized.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088194,1993,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_3088194

In this paper we propose that a firm's embeddedness in a network of ties is an important source of variation in the acquisition of competitive capabilities. We argue that firms in geographical clusters that maintain networks rich in bridging ties and sustain ties to regional institutions are well-positioned to access new information, ideas, and opportunities. Hypotheses based on these ideas were tested on a stratified random sample of 227 job shop manufacturers located in the Midwest United States. Data were gathered using a mailed questionnaire. Results from structural equation modeling broadly support the embeddedness hypotheses and suggest a number of insights about the link between firms' networks and the acquisition of competitive capabilities.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094082,1994,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_3094082

Our dynamic analysis of competitive interactions between pairs of commuter airlines in California reveals the idiosyncratic and asymmetric market microstructures that characterize dyadic competitive relationships and helps explain why firms grapple vigorously with some of their competitors while being passive toward others. We show that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between firms' rates of entry into and exit from each other's markets and the level of multimarket contact in competitor dyads. We also show how this basic curvilinear effect varies from dyad to dyad as a function of relative levels of multimarket contact with competitors in other dyads and the relative sizes of competitors in a focal dyad.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094105,1978,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_3094105

We compare resource complementarity, status similarity, and social capital as a basis of alliance formation. The findings indicate that the likelihood of investment banks' alliance formation is positively related to the complementarity of their capabilities, as well as their status similarity. Social capital arising from banks' direct and indirect collaborative experiences also plays a very important role in alliance formation. The number of deals given by a lead bank to a potential partner over the past three years has an inverted U-shaped relationship to the probability that the lead bank will invite the potential partner to form an alliance. Our findings indicate that status similarity and social capital have a stronger effect on alliance formation in initial public offering deals than in secondary offering deals, as the former are more uncertain than the latter. Using these findings, we discuss the role of complementarity, status similarity, and social capital in alliance formation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094116,1986,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_3094116

International experience and a strong institutional environment also should lead to increases in the equity position of the foreign investor. These relationships were tested with data on more than 1000 Japanese investments in nine countries of East and South-East Asia.

Drawing from contingency and resource-based arguments in the strategy and organizational theory literatures, we propose a distinctive analytical approach to identify environmental and organizational contingencies that should predict changes in a firm's strategy and the performance implications of such changes. We test our model using extensive longitudinal data from over 4000 U.S. savings and loan institutions during a period when many S&Ls considered changing strategic direction. The findings support our model of dynamic strategic fit. Specifically, we find that (1) the timing, direction, and magnitude of strategic changes can be logically predicted based on differences in specific environmental forces and organizational resources, and (2) organizations that deviated from our model's prediction of dynamic strategic fit (i.e., changed more or changed less than our model prescribed) experienced negative performance consequences.

0,0,0,Competencies and Firm Performance: Examining the Causal Ambiguity Paradox,"Resource-based theory argues that resources must be valuable, rare, inimitable, and lack substitutes to confer competitive advantage. Inimitability is a lynchpin of resource-based theory and central to understanding the sustainability of competitive advantage. Although scholars recognize a positive relationship between causal ambiguity and inimitability, the relationship among critical resources called competencies, causal ambiguity, and firm performance remains an unresolved conundrum. One perspective suggests that causal ambiguity regarding competencies and performance is necessary among internal and external managers for sustainable competitive advantage because it severely limits imitation. Causal ambiguity, therefore, enhances firm performance. Another view holds that causal ambiguity places a constraint on the transfer and leveraging of these competencies within a firm. In this case, causal ambiguity may adversely influence firm performance. This paper takes a resource-based view to develop and test hypotheses that relate managers' perceptions of causal ambiguity to their firm's performance. The hypotheses examine relationships between firm performance and (1) causal ambiguity regarding the link between competencies and competitive advantage, and (2) causally ambiguous characteristics of competencies. Research involving 224 executives in 17 organizations provides valuable insights into the relationships between causal ambiguity and firm performance. A model is then developed based on these findings. Particular consideration is given to the differing ways top and middle managers in a firm may experience causal ambiguity and to how these differences may be understood and managed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094255,1987,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_3094255

Controlling for industry, capital structure and nation effects we find a positive effect of ownership concentration on shareholder value (market-to-book value of equity) and profitability (asset returns), but the effect levels off for high ownership shares. Furthermore we propose and support the hypothesis that the identity of large owners-family, bank, institutional investor, government, and other companies-has important implications for corporate strategy and performance. For example, compared to other owner identities, financial investor ownership is found to be associated with higher shareholder value and profitability, but lower sales growth.

The study explored whether consensus building occurred during the strategic change and, if so, how. Initial participants of consensus were also investigated as well as changes in the scope of participants in consensus.

0,0,0,Dynamic Capabilities: What Are They?,"This paper focuses on dynamic capabilities and, more generally, the resource-based view of the firm. We argue that dynamic capabilities are a set of specific and identifiable processes such as product development, strategic decision making, and alliancing. They are neither vague nor tautological. Although dynamic capabilities are idiosyncratic in their details and path dependent in their emergence, they have significant commonalities across firms (popularly termed 'best practice'). This suggests that they are more homogeneous, fungible, equifinal, and substitutable than is usually assumed. In moderately dynamic markets, dynamic capabilities resemble the traditional conception of routines. They are detailed, analytic, stable processes with predictable outcomes. In contrast, in high-velocity markets, they are simple, highly experiential and fragile processes with unpredictable outcomes. Finally, well-known learning mechanisms guide the evolution of dynamic capabilities. In moderately dynamic markets, the evolutionary emphasis is on variation. In high-velocity markets, it is on selection. At the level of RBV, we conclude that traditional RBV misidentifies the locus of long-term competitive advantage in dynamic markets, overemphasizes the strategic logic of leverage, and reaches a boundary condition in high-velocity markets.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094429,1999,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_3094429
0,1,0,Corporate Boards and outside Stakeholders as Determinants of Environmental Litigation,"Each year, hundreds of firms are prosecuted for violating environmental laws and hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties are assessed. At the same time, a much larger number of firms escape the various costs associated with litigation by adhering to the provisions of the same laws and regulations. It is not a priori apparent why this dichotomy exists. In this paper we draw on corporate governance and stakeholder theories to empirically investigate environmental lawsuits. Specifically, we compare the pre-lawsuit profile of 209 violators to a sample of matched control firms between 1994 and 1998. We find that the likelihood of becoming a lawsuit defendant increases with board size, with the fraction of directors in industrial firms, and with the fraction of inside ownership, and decreases with the number of directorships held by outside directors. These findings are robust to alternative dependent variable specifications. Together, our results suggest that managers, researchers, and policy-makers need to direct their attention to the corporate board as the core decision-making unit forming corporate environmental policies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094474,1989,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_3094474

Following neoinstitutional theory, we focus on the coercive, normative, and mimetic effects that result from the exposure of firms in a given country to a powerful source of critical resources, a common pool of relevant technical knowledge, and the experiences of firms located in other countries. We use social network theory to develop a systematic conceptual understanding of how firms located in different countries influence each other's rates of adoption as a result of cohesive and equivalent network relationships. Regression results provide support for our predictions that states and foreign multinationals are the key actors responsible for coercive isomorphism, cohesive trade relationships between countries generate coercive and normative effects, and role-equivalent trade relationships result in learning-based and competitive imitation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094804,1999,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_3094804

Building on this observation, we propose a dynamic model capturing the mutual evolution of those attributions, managers' and workers' actions, and the production technology. We use the model to show how managers' beliefs about those who work for them, workers' beliefs about those who manage them, and the physical structure of the environment can coevolve to yield an organization characterized by conflict, mistrust, and control structures that prevent useful change of any type.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094806,1994,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_3094806

We extend neoinstitutional theory's proposition that prior decisions and actions by other organizations provide legitimization and information to a decision marked by uncertainty, showing that this effect holds when the uncertainty comes from a firm's lack of experience in a market but not when the uncertainty derives from the structure of a market's policymaking apparatus.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094871,1990,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_3094871

With data from a sample of large and diversified firms, we examine the extent to which newly appointed CEOs' strategic orientation determines whether they use their power to maintain the status quo or refocus their firms' business portfolios. We assess CEOs' power with seven widely used indicators and use experience as heir apparent to the prior CEO as a measure of new CEOs' strategic orientation. Overall, results show that CEOs' power use is influenced by heir apparent experience in predicting the level of corporate strategic refocusing.

0,0,0,Psychological and Physiological Stress Reactions of Male and Female Assembly Workers: A Comparison between Two Different Forms of Work Organization,"Psychological and physiological stress responses of 36 male and 29 female assembly workers were examined during and after work at a car engine factory. Two different ways of organizing assembly work were compared, (1) a more traditional assembly line with fixed work stations organized as a chain and involving short repetitive work cycles and, (2) a new and more flexible work organization with small autonomous groups having greater opportunities to influence the pace and content of their work. Each worker was examined during and after a normal day at work on 2 consecutive days and, in order to obtain endocrine baseline data, during a corresponding work-free period at home. As expected, both female and male workers in the flexible organization reported significantly more variation, independence and abilities to learn new skills at work. Workers in both forms of work organization showed a significant increase in urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine during work compared to the work-free day at home. Males had significantly higher epinephrine and systolic blood pressure levels than females. Successive self-reports of tiredness increased significantly more at the assembly line compared to the flexible work organization. In keeping with this, systolic blood pressure, heart rate and epinephrine increased significantly during the work shift at the assembly line but not during work in the flexible organization. Catecholamine levels revealed that the subjects were able to unwind more rapidly after work in the flexible organization. This pattern was particularly pronounced for the female workers. In summary, the various stress indicators support the notion that the flexible work organization induces less stress than the assembly line and that the female workers were able to benefit most from this new form of work organization.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3100203,1986,Journal of Organizational Behavior,10.2307_3100203
1,0,1,Perceptions of Observed and Model Values of Male and Female Managers,"To provide evidence of the relationship between expectations for the values that should be exhibited for effective performance by female and male managers and their actual values, data were used that had been collected as part of a leadership program conducted for managers of business organizations in the United States. From a pool of approximately 700 managers, samples were drawn of 130 male and 130 female managers. As part of leadership program, the managers had completed 26-item SYMLOG value questionnaires, rating themselves and the values they judged to be effective for a manager. Prior to their participation in the program, sets of ratings were made by the coworkers of each manager, rating the actual values of the manager and the coworkers' ideal profile for the manager. The questionnaire covers three dimensions of values: dominant versus submissive, friendly versus unfriendly, and accepting the task-orientation of established authority versus opposing it. Comparisons were made of self and coworkers' ratings on the observed (self/actual) and model (effective/ideal) values of female and male managers with 'matched' samples that include only female and male managers with similar ratings of actual values, as judged by their coworkers, by removing the ratings of 'outliers'. The only significant difference in gender ratings that remains is that female managers rate themselves as more positive. There are more differences between observed and model ratings. Managers and their coworkers believe that model managers should be more dominant and friendly than they are rated to be. However the managers also believe that they should be more task-oriented while their coworkers believe that they should be less task-oriented. The majority of the female managers dropped from the matched sample because no matching male could be found were more dominant and positive and less task-oriented, thus closer to the stereotype role for females.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3100215,1977,Journal of Organizational Behavior,10.2307_3100215

0,0,0,On Becoming Just Another Contractor: Contract Competition and the Management of Science at Sandia National Laboratories,"Private-sector companies have managed many of the national energy laboratories (like Sandia National Laboratories) since their inception during the Manhattan Project. Political leaders at the time argued that American companies were the best-equipped organizations to manage efficiently large-scale scientific and technical endeavors. However, by the 1990s the U.S. Congress and the Department of Energy (DOE) introduced contract competitions as a means of instilling greater market discipline and cost controls on the operation of the labs. In this paper, the types of changes stimulated by contract competition are explored through a case study of scientists and administrators working at Sandia National Laboratories. Sandia personnel see contract competition as having little to do with instilling market discipline or the performance of the contractor. Instead, contract competition is understood as an opportunity for the DOE to change fundamentally the terms and conditions governing lab operations. They describe each competition as a complicated three-way negotiation among the lab, the potential contractor, and the DOE, in which the primary topics of debate are on cost controls, performance metrics, and accountability rules. This paper examines the costs that such competitions impose on the operations of the laboratory.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3381061,2000,Public Performance & Management Review,10.2307_3381061

Exercising the model, we find that each of these factors may have a different impact on the trust dynamics of the system as a whole. Some of the factors lead to system stability and others to system breakdown. Cycles of trust and distrust are observed. These results may have some implications for business and governmental organizations, and we outline some areas of future research that might further advance our understanding of these dynamics.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3381208,2001,Public Performance & Management Review,10.2307_3381208

An approach is proposed that assumes the complex nature of public administration and tries to overcome the shortcomings of the democratic governance school, which focuses solely on variations in the attitudes of the subjects and not so much on their object (administrative institutions and outputs). It also seeks to avoid some of the methodological pitfalls in studies focusing too narrowly on the performance of particular public organizations.

0,1,1,It's All in the Name: Failure-Induced Learning by Multiunit Chains,"We examine factors leading multiunit chains to adopt a common naming strategy, that is, naming components in a manner that identifies them with each other and the overall chain, rather than a local naming strategy that identifies a chain's components with their locations but not each other. Because chains' naming strategies have been shown to be critical to their success, we examine the effects of component failures on naming strategies. We advance organizational and interorganizational learning processes to explain chains' adoption of local naming strategies, which stress local adaptation, or common naming strategies, which emphasize standardization. In contrast to past research emphasizing learning from success, we focus on learning from the failure of strategy, specifically, the failure of a chain's own and other chains' commonly and locally named components. Two fundamental results emerge from our analysis of Ontario nursing home chains' naming strategies from 1971 to 1996. One is that nursing home chains learned from their own and others' failures, and the second is that the chains learned less from failures when they had a historical investment in the failing strategy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3556618,1990,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_3556618

We develop the construct of ""subgroup strength,"" defined as the degree of overlap across multiple demographic characteristics among a subset of team members. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we propose that the presence of subgroups within a team may stimulate learning behavior and that organizational design features, such as performance management by an external leader, team empowerment, and the availability of a knowledge management system, may have different effects on teams, depending on subgroup strength. Data on 156 teams in five pharmaceutical and medical products firms confirmed that moderately strong demographic subgroups in teams fostered learning behavior. In addition, both very homogeneous and very heterogeneous teams were more inclined to engage in learning behavior, but only if we controlled for the concurrent effect of subgroup strength. Finally, subgroup strength moderated the impact of organizational design features on team learning. Overall, this study contributes to the literature on team composition, design, and learning by highlighting the importance of subgroups for understanding team behavior.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3556657,1997,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_3556657

The first shows that cognitive and emotional processes need to be taken into consideration to create changes in behavior. The second describes the sources of thoughts and feelings that may prompt anxiety and cause defensive reactions prohibiting change and productive use of talents. The third relationships triangle explains how an individual's previous experiences create patterns of response that are repeated throughout life and can become dysfunctional. Five major challenges in program design are also examined: selecting participants; identifying the focal issue on which participants need to work; the creation of a safe transitional space that enables the change process; using the group dynamic to foster transformation and to arrive at internalization of the change process; and the educational implications for faculty, facilitators, and coaches.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40214463,2007,Academy of Management Learning & Education,10.2307_40214463

0,1,0,Disinvestment: A New Problem in Multinational Corporation Host Government Interface,"The threat the multinationals hold over host governments is that of disinvestment and its consequences. This threat has become a major source of conflicts and misconceptions in recent years between the donors and recipients of foreign investment - multinationals and host governments respectively. Disinvestment, as far as multinationals are concerned, may be implemented either on a voluntary basis, if the decision is taken by the multinational itself, or on a involuntary basis, if the decision is taken by the host government through nationalization or expropriation. It is very often suggested that the major power the multinational has is in the investment area. Usually this is taken to be the power of deciding either to invest or not, in a particular country. The power of disinvestment is mentioned but only in a subsidiary sense. In reality the power in the disinvestment situation is greater than that of the investment situation, and can cause great concern on bothsides. In order to find a common ground between the interests of the host countries and the multinationals, aframework of triangular interaction between the multinationals, host governments and parent governments is considered with a focal point in the centre containing international organisations. /// Les gouvernements locaux se trouvent sous la menace que les sociétés multinationals pourraient se décider à diminuer leurs investissements dans le pays-hôte ou même à désinvestir, décision qui peut avoir des consé-quences graves pour le pays touché par une telle mesure. Cette menace potentielle a donné au cours des dernières années naissance à des conflits et des malentendus entre les donneurs et les bénéficiares des investissements étrangers, à savoir les sociétés multinationals et les gouvernements locaux. Sur le plan de la société multinationale, le désinvestissement peut être volontaire et notamment lorsque c'est elle qui prend la decision de désinvestir ou involontaire lorsque c'est le gouvernement local qui prend la décision de nationaliser ou d'exproprier la société. On dit très souvent que le pouvoir majeur de la société se trouve dans le domaine des investissements. Cepouvoir consisterait alors à décider d'investir ou non dans un pays déterminé. Le pouvoir de désinvestir est, il est vrai, rappelé, mais en fait considere comme un pouvoir subsidiaire. En réalité, une société multinationale se trouve dans une position plus forte lorsqu'elle devra prendre une décision de désinvestissement que lorsqu'elle se trouve confrontée avec une décision d'investissement, et cela peut occasionner bien des soucis aux parties en cause. Pour faciliter la recherche d'un dénominateur commun entre les intérêts du pays-hôte et les sociétés multinationales, l'auteur présente un cadre d'interactions triangulaires entre les sociétés multinationales, les gouvernements des pays-hôtes et les gouvernements des pays dans lequel se trouve domiciliée la société-mère, tan-dis qu'au centre du triangle sont figurées les institutions internationales. /// Die Drohung, welche internationale Unternehmen den Regierungen der Gastländer neuerdings entgegenhalten, ist die der Desinvestion und damit verbundene Konsequenzen.

Im ersten Fall wird diese Entscheidung vom Unternehmen selbst, im zweiten Fall von der Gastlandsregierung getroffen und wird über Verstaatlichung oder Ausweisung realisiert. Meistens wird der internationalen Unternehmung die größte Macht im Bereich der Investionstätigkeit auf der Basis von Investitionsentscheidungen zugunsten eines bestimmten Auslands zugeschrieben.

In addition, measures were obtained of the degree of centralization in decision-making as well as the level of satisfaction of a sample of employees in each firm. Net profits and net growth over the previous five years were used to assess managerial performance. Under competitive conditions, decentralization was positively related to employee satisfaction and managerial performance in both the Unitd States and South Africa. However, in South Africa, under non-competitive conditions, centralized firms were superior to decentralized firms in these respects. The different results obtained in the two countries are explained in terms of the greater need of United States employees to participate in decision-making and hence to react positively to decentralization, irrespective of market conditions. /// Cent trente cinq managers (cinq de chacune des quinze sociétés américaines interrogées et douze des sociétés sud-africaines) ont répondu à un questionnaire leur demandant comment ils voyaient ľétat de la concurrence dans leurs marchés respectifs.

Par contre, en Afrique du Sud, dans une situation d'absence de concurrence, les sociétés ayant un système centralisateur avaient de meilleurs scores dans ces deux domaines.

This type of leadership creates ""minimal"" social and task structures that, together with a perception of the task at hand as individually important to group members, invites the team to improvise.

However, in hidden profile experiments in which group members have common information favoring an inferior choice, with private information favoring a superior choice, groups typically choose an inferior alternative. We report a hidden profile experiment where we induce homogenous preferences over choice characteristics and provide financial incentives so that the common purpose assumptions of the model hold more completely than in past experiments. Nevertheless, groups continue to choose an inferior alternative most of the time. These failures primarily result from mistakes in recalling information. Mistakes in recalling common information (which favors an inferior candidate) are typically corrected, whereas mistakes in recalling the private information needed to uncover the hidden profile cannot be corrected. Therefore, the dismal performance of groups in pooling the information needed to identify the superior option primarily result from the structure of the problem rather than deficiencies in how groups share and process information. The discussions necessary to resolve mistakes in recalling common information also help to explain the often noted fact that groups spend a disproportionate amount of time discussing common information.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40539170,2009,Management Science,10.2307_40539170

Based on longitudinal data on the tenure histories of 193 CEOs who left office between 1993 and 1998, we find that the level of strategic change has an inverted U-shaped relationship with firm performance. As the level of change increases from slight to moderate, performance increases; as the level of change increases from moderate to great, performance declines. Further, we find that this inverted U-shaped relationship differs between firms led by outside CEOs and those led by inside CEOs. That is, both the positive effect of strategic change on firm performance when the level of change is relatively low and the negative effect of strategic change on firm performance when the level of change is relatively high are more pronounced for outside CEOs than for inside CEOs.

Growth decisions were analyzed in terms of three strategies and three mechanisms. Strategies include the expansion of existing practice areas, the development of new practice areas, and the development of branch offices. Mechanisms include internal development (promotion and transfer), lateral entry (the recruitment of attorneys at the partnership level), and merger. Results demonstrate organizational and strategic influences on growth decisions. A high associate-to-partner ratio induces promotion. Small size and the firm's reliance on a limited number of business-generators motivate lateral entry. The addition of new fields of practice impels the firm to add attorneys through lateral entry. Branch offices are opened by partner transfer and by merger. Results also show that profit increases are not related to the expansion of the existing practice but are associated with the development of new practice areas and branch offices. Profit is positively related to practice development when it is undertaken by lateral entry. However, branch office development is positively related to profitability only when clients use more than one of the firm's offices.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40604032,1994,Journal of Managerial Issues,10.2307_40604032

Forty-one male and 39 female audit seniors and 39 male and 41 female audit managers first reviewed audit working papers in which errors were seeded and then made a likelihood of fraud risk assessment. Half of the subjects reviewed working papers in which positive ethical information about the client was provided and the other half reviewed working papers in which the ethical information was not provided. Next, each auditor made a likelihood of fraud risk judgment relating the root cause of the errors they found during the review to the likelihood of fraudulent activities on the part of the client. The results indicate the auditor's gender has no bearing on his or her likelihood of fraud risk assessments, either when the positive ethical information was disclosed or undisclosed. Further, there was no interaction between gender and experience.

The effectiveness of these forms is dependent on the composition and experience of the team, their interpretation of the situation at hand, and their ability to formulate a timely response. However, competing demands from the team member's organizational affiliation and the specific needs of the crisis both influence response decision-making priorities and choices. Despite the timely importance of effective strategic decision making for crisis response, this area of research remains underexplored in the management literature. To examine how some of the extant literature on strategic decision making may improve crisis response effectiveness, this study examines the behavior of government officials responding to a simulated terrorism event.

0,1,0,Influence of MNC Network Configuration Patterns on the Volatility of Firm Performance: An Empirical Investigation,"Previous studies examining the influence of internationalization on the volatility of a firm's performance have found inconsistent empirical evidence. Earlier studies support a reduction in volatility resulting from a higher level of international operations. However, more recent studies have found evidence supporting a positive correlation between internationalization and various measures of firm risk. This study suggests that these results are inconclusive because of their narrow conceptualization of international strategy as a one-dimensional construct. This paper suggests that two dimensions implicit in the configuration patterns of MNC networks and their respective interaction may have distinct effects on performance volatility. Regression results using a sample of 320 U.S. firms from 133 SIC segments provide evidence supporting this view. Consistent with the earlier literature, the empirical results support the reduction in volatility derived from a greater dispersion of international operations. In addition, the global integration dimension of an MNC network configuration increases exposure to potential performance swings. Lastly, the interaction term between global integration and geographic dispersion tends to be negatively associated with volatility. These results help reconcile the prior literature and provide evidence for the multidimensional nature of the internationalization construct.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40658340,2009,MIR: Management International Review,10.2307_40658340

We begin by noting the uncertain conceptual status of the structure concept in the small groups literature and propose a conceptualization of team structure that is grounded in the long tradition of work on formal structure in the sociology and organization theory literatures. We then consider the thesis that, at least in self-managed teams dealing with stable tasks, greater team structureâ€” i. e., higher levels of specialization, formalization, and hierarchyâ€” can promote learning by encouraging information sharing, reducing conflict frequency, and fostering a climate of psychological safety; that is, we examine a mediated model in which the effect of structure on learning and improvement in teams is mediated by psychological safety, information sharing, and conflict frequency. This model was largely supported in a study of selfmanaged production teams in a Fortune 100 high-technology firm, although the observed pattern of mediation was more complex than anticipated. Higher structure was also associated with actual productivity improvements in a subsample of these teams.

We propose that increased worker mobility means that workers may now build their careers using interorganizational career ladders, working in certain kinds of organizations earlier in a career and in other kinds of organizations later in the career. We develop a matching framework that predicts such interorganizational moves based on how systematic changes in workers' needs and resources over the course of their careers alter the kinds of organizations they will best match. We specifically propose that workers will be more likely to work for organizations that provide more training early in their careers, and work for organizations that have higher demands for skills later in their careers. We use this argument to make three broad predictions: first, that interorganizational transitions are more likely to take place from larger to smaller workplaces, and into organizations in industries that employ a higher proportion of workers in the focal occupation; second, that such skill-based career paths are more common where the labor market provides more opportunities that reward those skills; and third, that the nature of external opportunities will disproportionately affect turnover from organizations on the lower rungs of the career ladder.

This study assesses parties' levels of agreement on the reciprocal obligations of the psychological contract, and their consequences on parties' perceptions of contract violations. Furthermore, the study examines subsequent reactions of both parties to perceived violations. Results indicate that managers and employees tend to disagree on the employee's obligations and violations of the contract but not on the organization's obligations and violations. More importantly, results from multivariate regression analyses indicate that employee tenure with the manager and leader-member exchange (LMX) as reported by the manager were positively related to agreement on employees' obligations. Agreement on employees' obligations was related to perceptions of violation by the manager, but in a direction opposite to that hypothesized. Both managers' perceptions of employee violations and employees' perceptions of organization violations were related to employee outcomes assessed by the managers and the employees. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4093707,2002,Journal of Organizational Behavior,10.2307_4093707
0,0,1,"A Field Study of Group Diversity, Participation in Diversity Education Programs, and Performance","This study examined the impact of four dimensions of diversity-tenure, age, sex, and race-on performance in 486 retail bank branches and assessed whether employee participation in the firm's diversity education programs influenced these relationships. Data came from archives of the demographic composition of branches, an employee attitude-satisfaction poll, and branch performance assessed as part of the bank's bonus incentive plan. Race and sex diversity were unrelated to performance. The direct effects of tenure and age diversity were largely negative, but were moderated by quality of team processes, suggesting that cooperation and teamwork may suppress potentially task-enhancing differences associated with these aspects of diversity. Diversity education programs had minimal impact on performance. The results of this study suggest that there is a complex relationship between age and tenure diversity and performance and that, even in firms with characteristics that should be conducive to performance benefits from diversity, other conditions must be in place to foster such effects.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4093765,1998,Journal of Organizational Behavior,10.2307_4093765

The purpose of this study was to explore the differential impact of surface-level diversity (gender, ethnicity), deep-level diversity (time urgency, extraversion), and two moderating variables (team orientation, team process) on relationship conflict over time. Hypotheses were tested by tracking 45 student project teams in a longitudinal design. Results revealed that team orientation and team process moderated the diversity-conflict link. Specifically, team orientation helped to neutralize the negative effects of surface-level (gender) diversity on relationship conflict. In a similar manner, team processes worked to weaken the deleterious effects of deep-level diversity (time urgency) on relationship conflict. In addition, relationship conflict resulted in lower perceived performance by team members.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4093783,1974,Journal of Organizational Behavior,10.2307_4093783

It illuminates the potentially negative outcomes of change at the level of the employee. In addition, it relates to the ongoing debate over how employees react to and respond to organizational change. I hypothesize that change increases the risk of negative stress, and I test this hypothesis using a comprehensive panel data set of all stress-related medicine prescriptions for 92,860 employees working in 1,517 of the largest Danish organizations. The findings suggest that the risk of receiving stress-related medication increases significantly for employees at organizations that change, especially those that undergo broad simultaneous changes along several dimensions. Thus, organizational changes are associated with significant risks of employee health problems. These effects are further explored with respect to employees at different hierarchical levels as well as at firms of different sizes and from different sectors.",external-fulltext-any,2011,Management Science,10.2307_41060715
0,0.5,0,Leadership and Arts Management,"In arts organizations, leadership is directed towards the achievement of an artistic goal and is the responsibility of the artists, regardless of their position within the organization. Management is in the service of and subordinate to this goal. The production of a work of art involves a quest for excellence, indeed the Absolute, requiring an obsessive pursuit of perfection and an image of excellence worthy of deep veneration and behaviour that may be considered excessive. While it is difficult to comprehend or describe talent or genius, the journey undertaken by artists in their quest for the sublime reflects a profound human need, as attested to by the fact that a dynamic elite is prepared to follow and support them in this quest. The work to be created or interpreted thus determines not only the strategic management of arts organizations, but also their structuring, which frequently takes the form of projects or events (adhocracy). While the board of directors is still officially the supreme authority of the arts organization -in North America, at least -it is difficult for this body to establish legitimacy beyond its role of ensuring the organization's continuity by raising capital. Moreover, the exercise of authority in arts organizations is determined by artistic rather than financial or ""humanist"" needs, which adds to the preponderance of artistic leadership over management within such organizations. Dans les entreprises artistiques, le leadership porte sur la finalité de l'oeuvre à produire et incombe aux artistes, quel que soit leur niveau dans l'organisation (interprètes, concepteurs-responsables ou directeurs). Le management (direction générale ou administrative) est au service de cette finalité artistique et lui est subordonné. La production d'une oeuvre d'art suppose, chez les créateurs et les interprètes, une quête d'excellence, voire d'absolu. À la direction artistique, elle implique un souci obsessif de la perfection, la recherche d'une image d'excellence digne de la plus grande vénération et des comportements parfois jugés excessifs. S'il est difficile de comprendre et d'expliquer ce qui fait le talent et le génie, on sait toutefois que la démarche des artistes dans la recherche des émotions les plus vives et les plus profondes correspond à un besoin fondamental de l'être humain, puisqu'une élite est disposée à les suivre et à les soutenir activement dans cette quête. L'oeuvre d'art à créer ou à interpréter est donc le noyau non seulement de la gestion stratégique, mais aussi de la structuration, qui prend la forme de projets ou d'événements (adhocratie). Si les conseils d'administration demeurent l'autorité ultime dont le rôle est de fournir le leadership au sein des entreprises artistiques, on constate qu'en Amérique du Nord du moins ils arrivent difficilement à asseoir leur crédibilité mise à part leur responsabilité d'assurer une continuité à l'organisme par la collecte de fonds. De même, la direction et l'exercice de l'autorité dans les entreprises artistiques sont influencés par les exigences de l'oeuvre plus que par des considérations financières ou « humanistes » , ce qui contribue encore davantage à la prépondérance du leadership artistique sur le management. En el seno de las empresas artísticas, el liderazgo está abocado a la finalidad de la obra que se realiza y recae sobre los artistas, independientemente del papel que éstos desempeñen en la organización (actores, diseñadores o directores). La dirección general o administrativa está al servicio de esta finalidad y queda subordinada a ella. La producción de una obra de arte supone la búsqueda de la excelencia, de lo absoluto, por parte de los creadores y actores. Esta búsqueda conlleva, por parte de la dirección artística, una preocupación obsesiva por alcanzar la perfección, el afán por encontrar una imagen de excelencia capaz de suscitar la mayor veneración, así como comportamientos que se pueden considerar excesivos. Si bien es dificil explicar lo que genera el talento y el genio de los artistas, se sabe que su búsqueda de las emociones más hermosas y violentas debe corresponder a una necesidad profunda de los seres humanos, ya que una élite muy activa está dispuesta a seguirlos y apoyarlos en este proceso. Por lo tanto, la obra de arte por crear o interpretar no sólo forma el núcleo de la gestión estratégica sino que también es el centro de la estructuración, que se traduce en proyectos o eventos ("" adhocracia""). Aunque las juntas directivas siguen siendo la máxima autoridad y deberían asegurar el liderazgo en las empresas artísticas, por lo menos en Aménca del Norte, constatamos que les cuesta asentar su credibilidad fuera de su ámbito, que consiste en asegurar la continuidad de la empresa mediante la recaudación de fondos. Asimismo, el ejercicio de la conducción y la autoridad está determinado más por las exigencias de la obra de arte que por consideraciones de tipo financiero o ""humanista"". Ello contribuye aún más a la preponderando del liderazgo artístico sobre la dirección de la empresa.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41064730,2001,International Journal of Arts Management,10.2307_41064730
1,1,0,Management Control and Museums,"For many years French museums have been undergoing numerous changes, both evolutionary and environmental.They now face an increasing need for more rigorous management whereby managers are given the means to establish new relations, to evolve and to adapt to their new environment, as well as the tools to function in their expanded role -in short, whatever resources are required to achieve their objectives. Management control is one means of responding to this necessary repositioning with all its attendant opportunities and constraints.This article presents the results of an investigation into the current situation in France and the management practices within French museums. Using a semi-structured interview method, the author researched several typical cases in order to understand how management control might be introduced into museums in France. Depuis un certain temps, on constate dans les musées de France de nombreux changements dus à leur évolution intrinsèque et à la transformation du contexte. De plus en plus, ces institutions ressentent le besoin d'une gestion plus rigoureuse qui fournirait aux managers les moyens d'établir de nouvelles relations, d'évoluer et de s'adapter à leur nouvel environnement, ainsi que les outils pour remplir leur rôle élargi - bref, toutes les ressources nécessaires pour atteindre leurs objectifs. Le contrôle de gestion, avec les possibilités et les contraintes qu'il comporte, s'avère une façon de réussir ce repositionnement incontournable. L'article présente les résultats d'une étude sur la situation actuelle en France et sur les pratiques de gestion museale. En utilisant une méthode d'entrevue semi-directe, l'auteure s'est penchée sur plusieurs cas types pour comprendre comment le contrôle de gestion pourrait être introduit dans les musées français.

0,0,0,Social Intervention or Market Intervention? A Problem for Governments in Promoting the Value of the Arts,"The long-standing arguments for state subsidy of the arts have recently been used to promote more aggressive strategies. It is no longer a case of the arts being funded merely as a public good. The trend across the Western world is for governments to actively promote this public good through education and awareness-raising, an extension of which is direct financial support to arts organizations for their marketing activities. This paper traces state intervention from support for the public good to subsidy for marketing, with particular reference to Australian policies and strategies. The author discusses the concept of relationship marketing, which is based on customer service, strategic development, mutual trust, commitment and values exchange, and the concept of value and its place in arts marketing. Using an ""intervention continuum,"" she describes the social and consumption values of the arts as outcomes of social and market intervention. Les arguments longtemps invoqués en faveur du financement public des arts ont été utilisés récemment à l'appui de stratégies plus agressives. Il ne s'agit plus simplement de soutenir les arts comme bien public. On constate en Occident la tendance chez les gouvernements à promouvoir ce bien public par l'éducation et la sensibilisation, et même à financer les activités marketing des organismes artistiques. L'article retrace l'intervention gouvernementale depuis la subvention d'un bien public jusqu'au financement du marketing, en faisant surtout référence aux politiques et stratégies du gouvernement australien. L'auteure discute du concept du marketing ciblé, qui est fondé sur le service à la clientèle, le développement stratégique, la confiance mutuelle, l'engagement et l'échange de valeurs, ainsi que du concept de valeur et de son rôle dans le marketing des arts. Dans un « continuum d'intervention », les valeurs sociales et celles de la consommation sont présentées comme les résultats de l'intervention de la société et de celle du marché. Los argumentos presentados a lo largo de muchos años a favor del subsidio público de las artes han comenzado a utilizarse recientemente con estrategias más decididas. Ya no se trata de que las artes ""son algo bueno para la gente"" y que se deben financiar por ser un bien o un beneficio público. En todo el mundo occidental se ha observado la tendencia de justificar la financiación de las artes, y los gobiernos han participado activamente en la promoción de este bien o beneficio afin de lograr una mayor concentizacón y educación artística en la población. Yendo más allá en esta actividad de promoción, los gobiernos o sus organismos otorgan financiación directa a las organizaciones de artes que son sus clientes para realizar actividades de marketing con miras a aumentar el nivel de audiencia y participación. En este trabajo se traza el camino de la intervención gubernamental, desde la subvención para benéfico público hasta los subsidios para planes y estrategias de marketing, haciendo referencia en particular a diversas políticas y estrategias gubernamentales en Australia. Se analiza asimismo la cuestión del marketing relacional fundado en el servido al cliente, el desarrollo estratégico y la interdependenda entre la confianza, el compromiso y el intercambio de valores, así como el concepto del valor y su interpretadón y utilizaaón en el marketing de las artes. Partiendo de una propuesta de continuidad en la intervendón, la naturaleza de los valores socales y de consumo en el campo de las artes se definen como resultados de la intervendón sodaly del mercado.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41064776,2002,International Journal of Arts Management,10.2307_41064776
0,0,0,The Influence of Market and Product Orientation on Museum Performance,"The marketing literature emphasises the importance of an organization's market orientation on its performance. In museums and other cultural organizations, however, the implementation of a marketing orientation should be intrinsically linked to a product orientation. The authors explain how the interrelationship of product orientation and market orientation influences a museum's economic and social performance. This empirical analysis of 182 Spanish museums reveals that social performance is strongly related to product and customer orientation, while economic performance depends mainly on social results and coordinated management. La littérature sur le marketing met l'accent sur l'importance de l'orientation marché pour la performance d'une organisation. Cependant, dans les musées et autres organismes culturels, l'adoption d'une orientation marketing devrait être intrinsèquement liée à une orientation produit. Les auteures expliquent comment interrelation entre les orientations produit et marché influe sur la performance économique et sociale d'un musée. Cette analyse empirique de 182 musées espagnols révèle que la performance sociale est étroitement liée à une orientation produit et client, tandis que la performance économique dépend surtout des résultats enregistrés au niveau social et d'une gestion coordonnée. Se enfatiza en las publicaciones sobre mercadotecnia la importancia que tiene para el desempeño de una organización su orientación comercial. En el ámbito, sin embargo, de los museos y otros entes culturales la orientación comeraal debe estar intrínsicamente vinculada al producto. Los autores explican cómo el rendimiento económico y social de un museo depende de la interreladón entre la orientación comercial y la orientación al producto. El análisis empírico de 182 museos españoles revela la fuerte vinculación del desempeño social con un enfoque orientado al cliente y al producto, mientras que el rendimiento económico depende principalmente de los resultados socales y la coordinación gerencial.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41064950,2008,International Journal of Arts Management,10.2307_41064950

0,0,1,Selection-Based Learning: The Coevolution of Internal and External Selection in High-Velocity Environments,"To understand the effects of selection on firm-level learning, this study synthesizes two contrasting views of evolution. Internal selection theorists view managers in multiproduct firms as the primary agents of evolutionary change because they decide whether individual products and technologies are retained or eliminated. In contrast, external selection theorists contend that the environment drives evolution because it determines whether entire firms live or die. Though these theories differ, they describe tightly interwoven processes. In assessing the coevolution of internal and external selection among personal computer manufacturers across a 20-year period, we found that (1) firms learned cumulatively and adaptively from internal and partial external selection, the latter occurring when the environment killed part but not all of a firm; (2) internal and partial external selection co-evolved, as each affected the other's future rate and the odds of firm failure; (3) partial external selection had a greater effect on future outcomes than internal selection; and (4) the lessons gleaned from prior selection were reflected in a firm's ability to develop new products, making that an important mediator between past and future selection events.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4131455,1992,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_4131455
1,1,1,Bringing Managers into Theories of Multimarket Competition: CEOs and the Determinants of Market Entry,"Multimarket (or multipoint) contact has been shown to deter aggressive actions by rivals toward each other, producing a situation of mutual forbearance among firms. To create this deterrent capability, however, firms must enter each others' markets, which is just the kind of action that the deterrent is supposed to limit. This study explores the questions: Under what conditions are firms likely to behave aggressively toward their multimarket rivals by entering their markets and when will they engage in mutual forbearance? We describe how the effect of multimarket contact on the market-entry moves of a firm changes as the level of contact a firm has with its rivals increases. We draw on competitive intelligence and decision-making theory to argue that the competitive advantages associated with multimarket contact are supplemented by the fact that a firm's multimarket competitors serve as a readily available model to reduce the uncertainty associated with market-entry decisions. We hypothesize that these factors lead firms to prefer, up to the point where forbearance concerns become paramount, to enter the markets in which their multipoint rivals already compete. We also argue that once multimarket contact levels reach the point where forbearance begins to operate, these levels also serve to stabilize the structure through better competitive intelligence, with the result that the propensity of a firm to enter into additional markets of its multimarket rivals declines. We then extend multimarket theory by focusing on the role of the CEO. Specifically, we argue that newer and longer-tenured CEOs are likely to face different influences on their preferences for particular competitive actions. We test hypotheses that link the likelihood that CEOs will abide by the mutual interdependencies that their firm's multimarket ties represent to their tenure in the CEO position. Our findings produce support for an inverted-U-shaped relationship between multipoint contact and market entry. We also find evidence that longer-tenured CEOs are guided by their firm's multimarket relationships. Newer CEOs, however, do not seem to adopt a forbearance approach toward their firm's multimarket competitors. Our findings have important implications for multimarket theory. This study is among the first to examine the role of managers within a multimarket context. We show that it is not enough for a firm to be embedded within a multimarket structure, but that for a firm to benefit from its multimarket position, its managers must be aware of this positioning and free of other influences that could cause them to behave in ways that are inconsistent with it. Because our findings show that newer CEOs can direct their firms to act in ways that are inconsistent with their firm's multimarket position, we identify an area of potential competitive vulnerability for the firm.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4135118,1987,Organization Science,10.2307_4135118
1,0,0,How Product Order Affects Market Identity: Repertoire Ordering in the U.S. Opera Market,"In this study, we view market identities as interfaces between organizations and their external audiences and examine how the perceived market appeal of organizations can be influenced by the order in which the products or product features that determine their market identities are offered. We theorize that when audiences have different product preferences, organizations may increase their perceived appeal to some or all audiences by making certain features more or less salient through different orderings without making substantive changes to their products or product portfolios. We find strong support for our arguments in statistical analyses of the market identities of U.S. opera companies from 1995 to 2005. When opera companies group unconventional operas together, their market appeal decreases among season-ticket holders, an audience for whom unconventional opera is less appealing, but increases among opera critics, an audience for whom unconventional opera is more appealing.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41410261,2011,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_41410261
0,0,0,Paying More to Get Less: The Effects of External Hiring versus Internal Mobility,"Individuals often enter similar jobs via two different routes: internal mobility and external hiring. I examine how the differences between these routes affect subsequent outcomes in those jobs. Drawing on theories of specific skills and incomplete information, I propose that external hires will initially perform worse than workers entering the job from inside the firm and have higher exit rates, yet they will be paid more and have stronger observable indicators of ability as measured by experience and education. I use the same theories to argue that the exact nature of internal mobility (promotions, lateral transfers, or combined promotions and transfers) will also affect workers' outcomes. Analyses of personnel data from the U.S. investment banking arm of a financial services company from 2003 to 2009 confirm strong effects on pay, performance, and mobility of how workers enter jobs. I find that workers promoted into jobs have significantly better performance for the first two years than workers hired into similar jobs and lower rates of voluntary and involuntary exit. Nonetheless, the external hires are initially paid around 18 percent more than the promoted workers and have higher levels of experience and education. The hires are also promoted faster. I further find that workers who are promoted and transferred at the same time have worse performance than other internal movers.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41410272,2011,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_41410272

We propose that these types of firms differ in dynamic capabilities, which help them overcome growth impediments and transition to incumbency in the industry. Growth impediments arise at larger size, older tenure levels in industry, and after technological discontinuities. Because of their prior experience, diversifying firms are better equipped to handle the challenges of impediments to growth. Meanwhile, de novo firms, ostensibly tailor-made for the targeted industry, are more likely to stumble over these growth challenges, and eventually lag behind diversifying firms. We find support for our hypotheses using a near census of firms in the U.S. wireless telecommunications industry over the 1983-2004 period.",external-fulltext-any,2012,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_41411167

Although the direct relationship between rational justification and initiative performance is significant, there is no evidence of the moderating effect for this form of influence.

Instead, victims perceive that a more bureaucratic approach is taken.

Drawing from prior turnaround research, we identify several prominent forms of CEO fit/misfit that are especially germane to troubled firms. In testing our hypotheses, we find substantial support for the fit/refit theory: troubled companies have substantially better performance to the extent that they replace incumbents who are poorly suited to the conditions at hand and when they appoint new CEOs who are well matched to those conditions. Further reaffirming the fit/refit model, we find that CEO replacement per se has no general effect on the improvement of troubled firms.",https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/full/10.1287/orsc.1100.0629,2012,Organization Science,10.2307_41429028

An example of such triad is a social structure comprising two producers connected via horizontal relationships and a customer connected to producers via vertical ties. Multiplex triads are important drivers of network evolution, but their dynamics remains poorly understood. Although conventional wisdom suggests that horizontal ties between producers are driven solely by their prior interactions, we find that vertical ties drive the formation of horizontal relationships in a multiplex triad. We also find that these triads are affected by the agency of the customers who (a) force producers into horizontal relationships with those producers that have protected the customers' interests in the past and (b) prevent closure in triads containing strong horizontal relationships because of the divergent objectives of these triads' members. By drawing attention to the existence of multiplex triads and their underlying dynamics, this paper advances a novel view on transitivity incorporating conflicting interests and agencies of actors within social systems.",external-fulltext-any,2012,Organization Science,10.2307_41429348

0,0.5,0,On Evaluation Costs in Strategie Factor Markets: The Implications for Competition and Organizational Design,"This paper uses a formal model to study how evaluation costs affect competition for resources in strategic factor markets. It finds that relative scarcity may not always benefit resource sellers. Rather, when competition among resource investors passes a certain threshold intensity, miscoordination among investors increases to the point that sellers 7 expected profits decline. This paper extends the model to consider how investors organize to overcome managerial agency in resource evaluation. Two organizational designs are considered: (a) incentivization, wherein a lower-level manager is motivated by an incentive contract to evaluate resources for an investor, and (b) supervision, wherein evaluation is either handled directly or closely monitored by headquarters. The model suggests that competition among investors will be associated with a greater use of supervision and that investors using supervision will tend to make lower offers. This paper also finds that supervision will be more common when valuable resources are rare.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41432796?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents,2012,Management Science,10.2307_41432796

We argue that this belief over-simplifies the complexity of exchanges that occur among the family firm's decision agents, and does not conform to reality. We develop an alternative agency view of family firm governance that accounts for agency problems that are understated in extant agency models. These problems are rooted in the firm's ownership structure, as well as the altruistic relationships that exist between the firm's decision agents.

We find that the market rewards firms forming alliances that contribute resources that can be synergistically combined with firms' own resources as well as with network resources accessed through their alliance portfolios.

Despite persistent interest in this issue, we do not yet have good answers to the question of how long it will take until more than a token number of women hold the CEO position. This study provides numerical estimates that help to answer this question, and also provides new information regarding the job responsibilities and positions in the executive hierarchy of women and men below the rank of CEO. This article presents the results of an extensive data collection effort that has yielded a comprehensive census of top executives in U.S. Fortune 1000 firms as of the year 2000. With regard to the pipeline to the CEO position, our data suggest that we should expect to see a slow increase in the percentage of CEOs that are women in the next five to ten years. Nevertheless, the percentage of CEOs that are women is likely to remain relatively low. As a result, our estimates suggest that if current trends continue, perhaps 6 percent of CEOs in the Fortune 1000 will be women by 2016. We also document the little known fact that almost 50 percent of the firms in the Fortune 1000 had no women as top executives as recently as the year 2000.

It was hypothesized that gender identity is related to career orientations such that women with a masculine gender identity strive for more upward mobility as compared to women with a feminine gender identity, whereas the latter strive more for balancing work and private life. A masculine gender identity was furthermore predicted to be positively related to career success in terms of income and hierarchical position. Finally it was expected that women with a feminine gender identity, in comparison to those with a masculine gender identity, express a lower self-efficacy with respect to stereotypical male and gender-neutral tasks and equal self-efficacy with respect to stereotypical feminine tasks.

Personnel economics as a research field has grown rapidly since the first text book on ""Personnel Economics"" was published in 1998. The development is driven by new theoretical insights based on institutional and behavioural economics and new empirical methods and data sets. Those new theoretical insights are very fruitful to analyze reasons and consequences of various human resource management practices, to understand what actually drives and motivates employees, and what causes organisations to be successful or to fail. With the new data sets and econometric methods the theories that have been laid out in personnel economics either many years ago or very recently can now be tested thoroughly. And the evidence produced by the new data and methods is strongly supportive, which is not only reassuring for researchers, but it also suggests that practitioners can actually rely on the ideas because they are born out in the data. So, personnel economics is not only a vivid research field, but also of great value for human resource managers, particularly for those taking strategic HR decisions. The fruitfulness of personnel economics is demonstrated with four examples: training strategies of companies, recruiting in tight labour markets, career incentives, team size and effort, and entrepreneurial signalling towards employees and creditors.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41783466,2004,Management Revue,10.2307_41783466

The subject of this article is how changes in the nature of the company and in the nature of the employment relationship affect the type of rules regulating the utilization of labour. Starting point of our analysis is that in both the company and the employment relation, market pressures are increasing. For the company this implies that the borderline between the organisation and its environment is becoming fluid and for the employment relation it implies that elements of market relations are on the increase. In the classic company the model of wage labour under a standard labour contract still dominates, while in the modern network/virtual company contracts for services is becoming a dominant way of utilization of labour. Between these two models many hybrid employment relations are developing, combining elements of both. The hybridisation of the employment relation poses several problems for HRM policy. In this article three new instruments for the management of hybrid employment relations are assessed: • competency based appraisal systems; • intensification of the dialogue between employee and supervisor; • individual choice benefits systems. • competency based appraisal systems; • intensification of the dialogue between employee and supervisor; • individual choice benefits systems.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41783480,2004,Management Revue,10.2307_41783480

There is a growing literature on international human resource management targeted at people studying management in large organizations which has encouraged an element of cultural sensitivity in HR practices. This paper is concerned with demonstrating how the capability approach can help link the world of work to wider socio-economic and citizenship development. Human exploitation (more negative) and raising returns to human capital (more positive) are compared to the capability approach as models for understanding the impact of human resource management activities. For the Capability Approach, it is important to take into account the potential impact of HRD on people working for a TNC and on their wider well-being outside the TNC. A case study of TNCs in Ghana is used to explore how the capability approach can be applied in practice. The paper concludes with some reflections on how the approach may help provide a conceptual framework for the global discourse on TNCs as potential developmental agents.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41783715,2012,Management Revue,10.2307_41783715

The analysis is based on the example of two banks, both of which undertook massive staff and cost reductions between 2001 and 2003. Downsizing measures like theirs are often met with resistance if they conflict with the interests, values or worldviews of stakeholders. Companies approach this threat of resistance by building a linguistic façade of legitimacy that suggests conformity with prevailing ideas of good or correct managerial conduct. Our metaphor analysis, which covers all publicly accessible texts of the two banks' own mass communication, identifies nine metaphoric concepts, which we further condense into three persuasive meta concepts: concealing metaphor, euphemistic metaphor, and urgency and control metaphor each fulfil different persuasive functions and vary systematically according to the conditions surrounding the managerial practice.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41783738,2013,Management Revue,10.2307_41783738

Drawing from the literatures on intergroup relations and status competition, our theory suggests how out-group biases and negative forms of envy toward higher-status minority CEOs may increase the propensity for white male CEOs to make negative or internal attributions for the low performance of the minority CEOs' firms. We also examine how CEOs' internal attributions in conversations with journalists increase the tendency for those journalists to attribute performance to internal causes in reporting on the minority CEOs' firms. We consider how the gender and race of journalists could moderate the influence of CEOs' performance attributions on journalists' reports, such that female or racial minority journalists would be less easily persuaded by white male CEOs' internal attributions for the low performance of firms with female or racial minority CEOs, and thus less prone to issuing negative statements about the CEOs' leadership. Empirical analyses based on original survey data from a large sample of CEOs and journalists provided strong support for our hypotheses. We discuss implications of the findings for theory and research on social discrimination in the corporate elite and social psychological determinants of corporate leader reputation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43185049,2013,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_43185049

In analyzing the emergence of social entrepreneurship, we have reviewed its relationship with the community, government, civil society organizations and businesses by incorporating Network Theory and Cluster Theory. We have not focused on individual characteristics, but on the relationship between social entrepreneurship and the stakeholders in the community.

However, even though market information is very important for the organization's adaptation to its environment, the vertical flow of strategic information has not been the main focus of market orientation researchers. In contrast, vertical strategic information flow has been the main theme from the middle management perspective of strategy process and knowledge creation theory. Although these research streams share an interest in information flow within an organization, they have remained separate traditions up until now. This paper tries to bridge the gap between these two research traditions by using a database of Japanese business organizations.

Combining insights from upper echelons theory, personality theory, and research on organizational responses to new technologies, we posit that narcissistic chief executive officers (CEOs) of established firms will be relatively aggressive in their adoption of technological discontinuities. We propose, however, that the effect of a CEO's narcissism on organizational outcomes will be moderated by audience engagement—the degree to which observers view a phenomenon as noteworthy and provocative—which varies over time. When audience engagement is high, narcissistic CEOs will anticipate widespread admiration for their bold actions and thus will invest especially aggressively in a discontinuous technology. Drawing from work on managerial cognition, we further hypothesize that CEOs' narcissism will influence their top managers' attention to a discontinuous technology, an association that will also be moderated by audience engagement. Finally, we suggest that managerial attention to the discontinuous technology will subsequently be reflected in company investments in the new technological domain. Results provide considerable support for our hypotheses and highlight the role of narcissism in the context of radical organizational change, the influence of audience engagement on executive behavior, and the effect of executive personality on managerial attention.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43546650,2013,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_43546650

I hypothesize that brokerage results from two distinct mechanisms: links with former coworkers and with friends of friends accumulated as careers unfold. Furthermore, I hypothesize that ""organizational misfits""â€”people who followed career trajectories that are atypical in their organizationâ€”will have access to more valuable brokerage opportunities than those whose careers followed more conventional paths. I tested this hypothesis with career history data recorded longitudinally for 30,000 employees in a large information technology firm over six years and sequence-analyzed to measure individuallevel fit with typical career paths in the organization. Network position was measured using a unique data set of over 250 million electronic mail messages. Empirical results support the hypotheses that diverse, and especially atypical, careers have an effect on brokerage through mechanisms rooted in social capital, even when accounting for endogeneity between networks and mobility. In theorizing about misfit from prototypical patterns, this paper offers a new, theory-driven application of sequence-analytic methods as well as a novel measure of brokerage based on interactions across observable boundaries, a complement to the structural constraint measure based on interactions across holes in social structure.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43548332,2012,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_43548332

This study integrates these perspectives to ask how disclosures might impact learning through failure. The study distinguishes between major and minor failures, asserting that public disclosures exert a distinct influence on learning through either form of experience. Related hypotheses are tested on failures arising within the US air-traffic control system. Although no support is obtained for predictions about major failures, the study finds that facilities can learn through minor failures but the process is impeded by public disclosures, suggesting the notable influence that these disclosures have over audiences' perceptions of the organization or its role in these events.

We develop scales to measure these constructs and show that new competence acquisition and competence enhancing/destroying are different from other innovation characteristics including core/peripheral and incremental/radical, as well as architectural and generational innovation types. We show that innovations can be evaluated distinctively on these various dimensions with generally small correlations between them. We estimate the impact these different innovation characteristics and types have on time to introduction and perceived commercial success. Our results indicate the importance of taking a structural approach to describing innovations and to the differential importance of innovation locus, type, and characteristics on innovation outcomes.

It explores grounded theory case study research findings from Traidcraft plc, a ‘values-based’ firm and a leading innovator within the social sustainability field. In light of Traidcraft's top-management commitment to move towards sustainability, this paper explores how Traidcraft is increasing its employee commitment to the company and its sustainability goals. Moreover, the effectiveness of Traidcraft's cultural development strategies over time is explored. Based on employee recommendations and developments over the past few years, the paper conceptualises an emergent strategy for Traidcraft. The paper's findings argue against using the ‘unitarist’ cultural, top-down approach, which represents the most popular strategy of the 1980s culture writers. Similarly, the findings also argue against the ‘pluralist’ cultural, bottom-up approach. Moreover, the findings argue that a business should adopt a contextually appropriate combination of both unitarist and pluralist principles. For Traidcraft's emergent strategy, a bias towards pluralism is proposed in order to take account of its enduring pluralist culture.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/greemanainte.31.71,1991,Greener Management International,10.2307_greemanainte.31.71
0,0,0,The Stakeholder Dashboard,"Sustainability and stakeholder engagement are closely interrelated; the former is virtually unachievable without the latter. While the corporation is increasingly paying lip service to stakeholder engagement, in practice there is much room for improvement. This lack of stakeholder engagement increases risks to the corporation and minimises its business opportunities. This article introduces a management tool, the stakeholder dashboard, which sustainability consultants can implement to help their clients improve stakeholder engagement by offering management vital stakeholder information at a glance. Its primary goal is to raise awareness and facilitate discussion among the corporation's management about the corporation's stakeholders. Through the systematised, periodic generation of the stakeholder dashboard, a reactionary environment can be combated by highlighting key stakeholders’ impressions toward the corporation in near ‘real time’ and can help the corporation identify gaps where it is ‘flying blind’. Measuring stakeholder perceptions is nothing new, but these perceptions are seldom (if ever) pulled together in a single dashboard and charted over time to give management a holistic view of the corporation's stakeholders.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/greemanainte.54.23,2007,Greener Management International,10.2307_greemanainte.54.23

1,0,0,Consulting for Sustainability: Creating a New Organisational Narrative,"Interface, Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of modular carpet (carpet tiles), made extraordinary progress towards becoming an ‘ecologically sustainable enterprise’ from 1994 to 2006. This paper demonstrates to consultants for sustainability how Interface consistently engaged in ten core sustainability practices. It engaged a wide range of stakeholders, incorporated languages from multiple disciplines and business functions, sought external validation, communicated the ‘sustainability’ message consistently, framed sustainability in terms of a higher purpose, rejected ‘greenwash’, developed a comprehensive measurement system called EcoMetrics™, blended the institutional with the innovative, persevered in the face of internal opposition to the new narrative and built a team committed to sustainability. The paper concludes with a detailed discussion of specific ways in which consultants can implement this process of authoring a new organisational narrative that will help firms move in the direction of ecological sustainability.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/greemanainte.54.69,1993,Greener Management International,10.2307_greemanainte.54.69
0,0,0,Learning from Experience: The United Nations Global Compact Learning Forum 2002,"In December 2002, representatives from more than 100 companies, labour and nongovernmental organisations, government, and about 30 academics convened in Berlin for the second Learning Forum of the United Nations Global Compact initiative. From the perspective of observer, I synthesise the discussion and learning that evolved out of the meeting, focusing on the much-discussed need for a tenth principle on transparency, and then on three levels of analysis where GC implementation is occurring. First is the micro (firm) level, where process of inspiration (visioning and commitment), integration, and improvement and indicators/measures are paramount. Second is the meso (industry, regional) level where industry pacts and processes of multi-stakeholder dialogue hold promise. Third is the macro level where multi-sector collaborative processes and a focus on social problem-solving are critical. Although the GC has not yet reached a tipping point, the evolving multi-level network structure has the potential to create one.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.11.51,2002,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.11.51

Historically, Perez-Companc inherited many social and environmental problems when it acquired parts of the state-controlled oil production structure in the beginning of the 1990s. The text examines the external and internal factors that led to changes in management, as well as how environmental and social affairs in the company evolved from being an appendix to the rest of the company to become part of the business strategy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.21.71,2002,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.21.71

Short case studies are used to demonstrate both the virtues and the limitations of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery in reducing corrupt practices. In order to make progress in reducing corruption from the supply side, the article argues that it is critical to look beyond compliance with laws. Further attention is paid to non-legal mechanisms including corporate accountability indexes, adoption of voluntary standards and reporting principles, and corporate collective action.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.29.33,2001,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.29.33
0,0,0,Post-traditional Corporate Governance,"How does competition among economic actors determine the value that each is able to appropriate? We provide a formal, general framework within which this question can be posed and answered, and then provide several results. Chief among them is a condition that is both required for, and guarantees, value appropriation. We apply our methodology to (i) assess the familiar notion that uniqueness, inimitability, and competition imply value appropriation, and (ii) determine the value appropriation possibilities for an innovator whose unique discovery is of use to several others who can compete for the right to use it.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.31.31,2005,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.31.31
0,0,0,Business as a Vocation,"The honest delivery of sound-quality goods and services in exchange for money is an essential part of any society and can be a vocation, depending on the approach to the task, and the values that shape how it is done. Businesses can develop civilised communication with customers and between workers of all sorts, as well as trustful relations, contractual or otherwise, across religious, ethnic and national boundaries. Where governments deviate from accepted norms of behaviour, cooperative interbusiness relations provide an alternative to an isolationist and exclusionary sanctions regime. Responsible business activities build a private sector not dependent on government; sanctions destroy this private sector and concentrate economic power in the government and its cronies. Business engaged in such efforts should subscribe to principles such as those of the UN Global Compact and report openly on how the principles are applied. The application of such standards demonstrates in practice that eschewing corruption and establishing sound work practices are in fact good business, leading to change.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.55.9,2014,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.55.9
1,0,0,Rhetorical Strategies for Claims of Corporate Sustainability,"We analyse how North American corporations faced with the ambiguous but legitimating mandate to be “green” engage in rhetorical strategies to portray themselves as sustainable. We examine corporate claims of sustainability across four North American industries to identify dominant rhetorical logics, to see how these logics may be combined into arguments for sustainability, to observe whether firms are converging on common rhetorical strategies, and to determine if corporations certified as sustainable share common rhetorical strategies. We found three main corporate rhetorical logics: arguing for logical, efficiency reasons for sustainability; arguing that the firm was a leader in sustainability; and arguing that the firm produced social benefits to the community. Firms across all industries were likely to argue for logical reasons to be sustainable, and to maintain they were sustainability leaders, but companies judged by an outside rating agency were more likely to add arguments for social benefits of corporate efforts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.59.148,1987,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.59.148
