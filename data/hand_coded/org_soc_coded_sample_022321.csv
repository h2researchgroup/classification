1,Where Do Interorganizational Networks Come From?,"Organizations enter alliances with each other to access critical
                    re‐sources, but they rely on information from the network of prior
                    alli‐ances to determine with whom to cooperate. These new alliances
                    modify the existing network, prompting an endogenous dynamic be‐tween
                    organizational action and network structure that drives the emergence of
                    interorganizational networks. Testing these ideas on alliances formed in three
                    industries over nine years, this research shows that the probability of a new
                    alliance between specific organi‐zations increases with their
                    interdependence and also with their prior mutual alliances, common third
                    parties, and joint centrality in the alliance network. The differentiation of
                    the emerging network structure, however, mitigates the effect of interdependence
                    and en‐hances the effect of joint centrality on new alliance
                    formation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/210179,1999,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_210179
1,Civil Rights Law at Work: Sex Discrimination and the Rise of Maternity,"By the time Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, many employers had created maternity leave programs. Analysts argue that they did so in response to the feminization of the workforce. This study charts the spread of maternity leave policies between 1955 and 1985 in a sample of 279 organizations. Sex discrimination law played a key role in the rise of maternity leave policies. Building on neoinstitutional theory, this article explores how the separation of powers shapes employer response to law. Details of the law are often specified in administrative rulings‐the weakest link in the law because they can be overturned by the courts and by Congress. Yet an administrative ruling requiring employers with disability leave programs to permit maternity leave, which employers successfully fought in the courts, was at least as effective as the identical congressional statute that replaced it. In the American context, the legal vulnerability of administrative rulings can draw attention to them, thus making the weakest link in the law surprisingly powerful.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/210317,1999,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_210317
1,Between Markets and Politics: Organizational Responses to Reform in China,"In China's economic transition, firms diversify assets through investments in the rapidly expanding service sector in response to organizational uncertainty. Using data from a random sample of firms in Shanghai, the author shows that there are two situations that cause this uncertainty: economic instability, where weak firms struggle to survive in the rapidly changing market system, and administrative instability, where large firms that were the most protected are now being forced to handle the responsibilities that were previously handled by the state. The result is that both types of firm seek stability by spreading out risk through investment in low‐risk, fast‐return markets, revealing much about the economic reforms.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/231084,1997,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_231084

1,Kinship Networks and Entrepreneurs in China’s Transitional Economy,"This research draws insights from two theoretical traditions: one is new institutionalism, which emphasizes the role of institutions, both formal and informal, in economic growth; the other is social network analysis, which highlights the role of interpersonal relations in producing and enforcing informal norms. Integrating these two approaches yields the thesis that social networks affect economic growth via enforcing informal institutions. The article focuses on the economic payoff of kinship networks in the context of China’s rural industrialization to argue that kin solidarity and kin trust played an important role in protecting the property rights of private entrepreneurs and reducing transaction costs during the early stages of market reform, when formal property rights laws were ineffective and market institutions underdeveloped. Data from 366 villages show that the strength of kinship networks has large positive effects on the count and workforce size of private rural enterprises and insignificant effects on collective enterprises.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/382347,2004,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_382347
1,What Is Organizational Imprinting? Cultural Entrepreneurship in the Founding of the Paris Opera,"Organization theorists have long recognized that organizations take on elements from their environments in the course of being founded. This observation, articulated by Stinchcombe in 1965 and known today as the “organizational imprinting hypothesis,” is frequently cited but remains little understood. Advances in cultural sociology and entrepreneurship studies have provided tools for unpacking this process. The author draws on these tools to underscore the role played by entrepreneurs in selecting and incorporating historically specific elements that may remain for decades or even centuries as fundamental features of the organization in question. The founding of the Paris Opera under Louis XIV serves as the basis for theorizing organizational imprinting at founding as an outcome of cultural entrepreneurship.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/517899,2007,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_517899
1,"Homeward Bound? Interest, Identity, and Investor Behavior in a Third World Export Platform","Are indigenous investors in Third World export platforms more stable than their allegedly “footloose” foreign rivals? While mainstream economists hold that investor behavior is independent of investor identity and therefore call for the parallel treatment of domestic and foreign firms, their critics hold that indigenous investors are more dedicated than their foreign counterparts and therefore call for industrial policies designed to cultivate and defend native entrepreneurs. Who is correct? The author uses a unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data to document and account for the relative stability and dynamism of indigenous investors in the Dominican Republic’s largest export processing zone and thereby brings economic sociology back from the margins of development theory—and development theory back into the heartland of sociology.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/588742,2008,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_588742
1,Corporate Unity in American Trade Policy: A Network Analysis of Corporate-Dyad Political Action,"This essay examines factors that produce political unity among large U.S. corporations advocating free trade. Expanding on old debates, these data and analyses validate the importance of organizational and class cohesion approaches to corporate political action. Methodologically, the political unity of pairs (dyads) of firms in trade policy activism is analyzed with quadratic assignment procedure regression. Shared membership in prominent policy networks and board interlocks positively predict corporate political unity across three areas of trade policy influence, from the executive branch to the legislature. Non-network organizational indicators also significantly predicted corporate trade policy activism. The findings support business unity accounts of corporate political action and suggest that higher levels of firm embeddedness within intercorporate networks facilitate collective corporate political action.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/657524,2011,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_657524
1,The Credit Crisis as a Problem in the Sociology of Knowledge,"This article analyzes the role in the credit crisis of the processes by which market participants produce knowledge about financial instruments. Employing documentary sources and 87 predominantly oral history interviews, the article presents a historical sociology of the clusters of evaluation practices surrounding ABSs (asset-backed securities, most importantly mortgage-backed securities) and CDOs (collateralized debt obligations). Despite the close structural similarity between ABSs and CDOs, these practices came to differ substantially and became the province (e.g., in the rating agencies) of organizationally separate groups. In consequence, when ABS CDOs (CDOs in which the underlying assets are ABSs) emerged, they were evaluated in two separate stages. This created a fatally attractive arbitrage opportunity, large-scale exploitation of which sidelined previously important gatekeepers (risk-sensitive investors in the lower tranches of mortgage-backed securities) and eventually magnified and concentrated the banking system’s calamitous mortgage-related losses.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/659639,2011,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_659639

1,Negotiated Orders: The Negotiation of Directives in Paramedic-Nurse Interaction,"Whereas the “negotiated order approach” emphasizes the importance of communicative events in the constitution of organizational settings, there has been little attempt to formally describe the properties of talk that occur in these settings. This article demonstrates that detailed examination of the temporal unfolding of negotiative processes contributes to our understanding of the bundle of tasks which comprise organizational settings. Through close analysis of the negotiation of directives in paramedic calls for emergency field orders, I demonstrate that negotiation is more than a metaphor for describing organizational order; real-world negotiations are complex interactional processes which can be described in their rich detail.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/si.1994.17.2.165,1994,Symbolic Interaction,10.1525_si.1994.17.2.165
1,SPEECH DURATION AND DEPENDENCIES IN INITIALLY STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED TASK GROUPS,"We examine whether speech durations and speech content vary by social structure in groups and the content of preceding speeches. When actors are structural equals in groups, an observable interaction order
         emerges from interaction processes. When we experimentally impose authority, skill, or sentiment structures, structural advantage is related to longer speech durations. When structures are combined such
         that an actor is advantaged in more than one social structure, then the actor engages in shorter speech durations, although dominance (as measured by perceived contributions to the group) remains high for
         the actor. In addition, the likelihood that an actor contributes a solution to a group problem or invites other contributions is highly dependent on whether the preceding speech included positive feedback.
         The expected interdependence between contributions and invitations to contribute was not evident in our data. Thus our research provides new insight on the sequential dependencies between speech acts in
         groups.

1,Flexibility and Fairness: Effects of the Network Form of Organization on Gender Equity in Life Science Careers,"Why do women have more opportunities in some employment settings? I investigate how organizational form affects gender stratification among life scientists. I propose that firms governed by networks, rather than bureaucracies, allow for greater equity. Hierarchy and rules hide gender bias, while reliance on ties outside the organization provides transparency and flexibility. I analyze the careers of 2,062 U.S. life scientists and interviews with 41 scientists. I examine employment data by gender for two patterns: early entrance into the biotechnology industry and promotion within network and hierarchical organizations. Gender does not affect when a scientist enters the biotech industry but is related to promotion. Men are more likely to attain early supervisory-level positions across organizational settings. Female scientists are nearly eight times more likely to supervise in biotech firms than in more hierarchical settings. The two organizational forms—network and hierarchy—provide different employment experiences for female scientists.

1,Leadership Structures in Same-Sex Task Groups,"ABSTRACT: This article investigates contradictory findings reported in the literature concerning differences in leadership differentiation between same-sex groups. Drawing on arguments developed by Walker et al. (1996) addressing measurement validity in this literature, and on an extension in the status literature developed by Ridgeway (1988) and Fennell et al. (1978), this article develops and tests three predictions. Specifically, the authors predict greater differences in leadership differentiation between allmale and all-female groups when assessing leadership based on procedural behaviors than when assessing leadership based on influence. Also, leadership differentiation will be greater in all-male groups within a male-dominated organization, and in all-female groups within a female-dominated organization, than in all-female groups within a male-dominated organization when assessing leadership based on procedural compared with influence behaviors. Contrary to predictions, results show that all-male and all-female groups are equally likely to develop differentiated leadership structures when using procedural- and influenced-based measures. Implications of these results are discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sop.2006.49.3.391,2006,Sociological Perspectives,10.1525_sop.2006.49.3.391
1,"Ethnic Matching of Supervisors to Subordinate Work Groups: Findings on ""Bottom-up"" Ascription and Social Closure","Research on minority authority attainment tends to stress top-down processes of social closure, whereby the dominant social group produces and preserves positions of power and influence by excluding out-group
         members. We argue that this view, while helpful, is incomplete. Returning to Weber's original conceptualization of social closure, we argue that top-down exclusion often generates pressures for bottom-up
         ascription, whereby employers match supervisors to the social characteristics, particularly race and ethnicity, of their subordinate work groups. Results from the Multi-City Survey of Urban Inequality strongly
         support our argument and also reveal that bottom-up ethnic matching reduces perceptions of racial discrimination among subordinates. These results offer a useful corrective to the assumption that elites
         only reproduce themselves and underscore the importance of group composition for understanding mobility opportunities available to minority workers.

1,"Networks of Opportunity: Gender, Race, and Job Leads","Researchers have commonly invoked isolation from job opportunities as an explanation for persistence of gender and race inequality in the labor market, but few have examined whether access to information about job opportunities varies by race and gender. Findings from nationally representative survey data reveal significant white male advantage in the number of job leads received through routine conversations when compared to white women and Hispanics. Differences in social network resources (social capital) partly explain the deficit among Hispanics, but fail to account for the job lead gap between white women and men. Further analyses show that inequality in the receipt of job information is greatest at the highest levels of supervisory authority, where white males receive substantially more job leads than women and minorities.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2009.56.3.385,2009,Social Problems,10.1525_sp.2009.56.3.385
1,The “State” of Equal Employment Opportunity Law and Managerial Gender Diversity,"Women’s underrepresentation in management is a persistent social problem. We take a new approach to understanding the lack of managerial gender diversity by investigating how U.S. state equal employment opportunity laws are related to women’s presence in upper and lower management. We draw on data from 2010 EEO-1 reports documenting managerial sex composition in U.S. work establishments and a state employment law database to answer our research questions. State mandates are found to be differentially associated with upper- versus lower-level managerial gender diversity. Establishments in states with an equal pay law, or that once ratified the ERA, employ more women in upper management than those in states without such a law or in nonratifying states, but this holds only in establishments in industries that typically employ women. In contrast, establishments in states that require anti-discrimination workplace postings employ fewer women in upper-management than those in states without such a requirement. State equal pay laws, especially those adopted before federal equal pay legislation, family responsibility discrimination protections, and past ERA ratification are positively associated with women’s lower-level managerial presence. Conversely, state expanded family and medical leave coverage, prohibited sex discrimination, and specific posting rules are negatively associated with women’s presence in lower management. Results hold net of establishment, state, firm, and industry factors. We discuss the meaning behind differences across managerial level and the role of state regulation in moving toward greater managerial gender equity.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2014.12319,2005,Social Problems,10.1525_sp.2014.12319
1,Government Regulatory Powers and Church Autonomy: Deviant Groups as Test Cases,"The current proliferation of legal conflicts over ""church autonomy"" reflects the incompatibility of two contemporary tendencies: 1) the functional diversification of constitutionally protected religious organizations; and 2) the expanding regulatory mandate of the state to enforce public accountability of organizations for harmful or fraudulent practices. This paper examines several cases involving the financial practices of deviant movements, including the conviction of Sun Myung Moon for tax evasion and the intervention of the California Attorney General in the finances of the Worldwide Church of God. These cases have elicited widespread concern among mainline church leaders, who appear to interpret them as boundary-defining engagements whose outcomes will yield rules applicable to the legal status of churches in general. These cases illustrate the difficulties faced by churches in attempting to legitimate diversified structures of economic rationality in terms of (individual) freedom of religious conscience.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1385815,1974,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1385815
1,Parish Autonomy: Measuring Denominational Differences,"This study examines the utility of a multidimensional scale of formal authority in assessing the relationship of denominational structure and local church activities. The scale is compared with two typologies of formal polity which are often used in studying religious organizations, and is found to have greater predictive power and more potential to discriminate between denominations than either of the typologies. The analysis includes a discussion of how congregational/denominational power relationships might affect local church participation in different sectors of the local interorganizational network.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1385971,1981,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1385971
1,Church Friendships: Boon or Barrier to Church Growth?,"Questionnaire results from 762 attenders of five Baptist congregations suggest that the number and quality of friendships available within a congregation heavily influence attenders' church selection decisions. Ironically, the churches with the highest numbers of church friends per attender are either stable or declining. Newcomers find such churches ""cliquish"" because high-tenure members have as many friends as they want or can manage. The ability of church friendship networks to incorporate newcomers appears to decline as average tenure and number of church friends increase. In contrast, attenders of the two growing churches have lower attendance tenure, fewer church friends, and greater desire for additional church friends. They are thus more inclined to incorporate newcomers, which further facilitates their growth.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386575,1981,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1386575
1,Anonymity and the Rise of Universal Occasions for Religious Ritual: An Extension of the Durkheimian Theory,"In this research, Durkheim's theory of the universalization of religious beliefs is extended to analyze the occurrence of religious rituals. Drawing upon Schutz's phenomenology of social relations, we amplify theoretically the Durkheimian perspective and suggest that the universalization process is stimulated by an increase in anonymity (as opposed to intimacy) in society. Structural factors consistent with anonymity -- i.e., increasing population density, political and economic differentiation, and monetary exchange -- are hypothesized to influence the universalization of ritual occasions. A recursive path model is devised for the hypothesized relationships in the universalization process. We find support for the model using data from a cross-cultural sample of nonindustrial societies. The implications of these results for understanding religious rituals in contemporary complex societies are then discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1387003,1981,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1387003
1,"""Brainwashing"" Theories in European Parliamentary and Administrative Reports on ""Cults"" and ""Sects""","This study examines the recent rash of official reports done by governmental agencies in Western Europe to guide policy development in those societies. Particular attention is given to reports in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, and Italy, and to the changes in such reports that have occurred, perhaps because of the influence of scholarly critiques offered for some of the earlier reports. The reports are divided into ""Type I"" and ""Type II"" reports, with the former being thorough-going in their anti-cult orientation, and the latter reports being more moderate in tone, with some attention paid to scholarship on new religions. However, the major thesis of the study is supported, as an examination of both types of reports reveals that they incorporate ""brainwashing"" and ""mind control"" imagery imported from the United States, even though such theories have been largely discounted within the United States. Use of such theories leads directly to some questionable policy recommendations, as demonstrated in the reports. Reasons for the spread of ""brainwashing"" ideas to Europe are discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1387941,1984,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1387941
1,"The Effects of Geographical Variability on Protestant Church Membership Trends, 1980-1990","Differences in the recent membership trends of liberal and conservative Protestant denominations have been a major focus of research on church growth and decline. This study examines the role of local contextual factors on these membership trends through their interaction with the detailed geographical distributions of eight large denominations, including four conservative groups and four more liberal groups. Results indicate that during the 1980s the more liberal groups tended to be concentrated geographically in places where contextual factors discouraged membership growth, while the conservative churches were concentrated in locations with conditions more conducive to membership growth. The findings suggest that the cumulative effects of local contextual factors have played a significant role in the contrasting patterns of membership change within liberal and conservative Protestantism in recent decades.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1388146,1995,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1388146
1,Reexamining Resistance as Oppositional Behavior: The Nation of Islam and the Creation of a Black Achievement Ideology,"Influential work on oppositional culture explains involuntary minorities' disadvantage as the result of a culture that discourages academic effort by branding it as ""acting white,"" which leads students to resist schooling. Much of this work depicts involuntary minority cultures as internally uniform. This article challenges the oppositional-culture explanation in three important ways: (1) by demonstrating that through the religious tenets and practices of the Nation of Islam (NOI), young female members develop a black achievement ideology, resulting in the adoption of the kind of studious orientation to school that is usually demonstrated by voluntary immigrant groups; (2) by demonstrating the ways in which black people differentially make sense of and enact what it means to be black that challenge previous binary or dichotomized accounts of black oppositional social identity; and (3) by illustrating how resistance for NOI young women is transformative, as well as reproductive, of existing patterns of social, racial, and gender relations. The evidence, from a two-year ethnographic study of female high school students who were in the NOI suggests a systematic reexamination of the oppositional theory and its main suppositions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1519868,1977,Sociology of Education,10.2307_1519868
1,"Challenging Medicine: Law, Resistance, and the Cultural Politics of Childbirth","Whereas most sociolegal studies concerned with hegemony and resistance focus on the resistances of ordinary citizens in everyday life, this article focuses on the development of a particular social movement--the alternative birth movement--and analyzes the process by which this movement emerged and has achieved significant legislative victories. The analysis makes several contributions to the literatures on hegemony, resistance, and the law. First, by demonstrating the importance of medicine's assertion of its authority for the expansion and mobilization of the alternative birth movement, we show that the mobilization of the law by a dominant group may trigger the emergence of social movements seeking to resist hegemonic understandings and arrangements. At the same time, by examining how birth activists' organizational resources developed over time and were rendered meaningful in legislative debates, our study demonstrates the importance of avoiding dichotomous conceptions of structure and culture. In addition, by analyzing culture as a process of meaning-making rather than an independent and hierarchical set of values, the analysis shows how cultural and legal hegemony--even that of modern medicine--may be destabilized, even as it sets the terms of the effort to destabilize it and shapes the nature of the hegemony that will replace it.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1555122,1992,Law & Society Review,10.2307_1555122
1,The Organizational Niche,"Although the concept of niche has been extremely useful in sociological theory and research, some aspects of the concept have not been clearly developed. This article advances a theoretical reconstruction of the concept of niche, with special application to organizations. The proposed formal model unifies several active lines of sociological theory. It also extends the notion of the niche from the realm of behaviors to apply to the rules coding social identities and organizational forms. The reconstruction gives deeper insight into the niche of an organizational population as well as individual organizations. Finally, the model analyzes the (thus far) tacit assumption that niches are convex, examines the implications of convexity for commonly used measures of niche width, and provides a general sociological argument for the predominance of convex niches.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1602329,2000,Sociological Theory,10.2307_1602329

1,Organizational Context and the Sexual Harassment of Clergy,"When the term sexual harassment is used is association with the clergy, the common assumption is that it is sexual abuse by the clergy which is being discussed. This assumption tends to obscure another serious issue that has received little scholarly attention--the sexual harassment of clergy by church members and colleagues in ministry. This study investigates both the factors that contribute to the chances of clergy experiencing harassment, and the impact of abuse on clergy work outcomes. Because there is so little research on the sexual harassment of clergy, the more general literature on sexual harassment in the workplace (from organizational and sociology of work research) must be relied on in framing the study. A unified approach is used, which suggests that features of modern organizational structures which are known to increase satisfaction will help to create a supportive climate in the workplace that will reduce the likelihood of incidents of harassment. Support is found for the value of organizational context as a means of explaining both the causes and outcomes of clergy experiences of harassment.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20453229,2008,Sociology of Religion,10.2307_20453229
1,Turkish Migrants' Organizations: Promoting Tolerance toward the Diversity of Turkish Migrants in Germany,"Since the beginning of their migration, Turkish migrants (TMs) have formed numerous civic organizations of diverse types in Germany. Various studies have examined the social, economic, and political situation of Turkish migrants in Germany over the past fifteen years. A gap persists concerning the role of Turkish migrants' umbrella organizations (TMUOs) as antiracist organizations and representatives of the Turkish migrant community. While they establish relations with German political parties, trade unions, and municipal authorities, it is unclear whether such interactions are motivated by TMUOs' interest in promoting tolerance toward the diversity of Turkish migrants in Germany. Combining approaches from organizational sociology and migration research, this article aims to generate an empirically founded knowledge of TMUOs and how they have reacted to various German policies of acculturation. It is specifically concerned with: (1) the aims and activities of TMUOs; (2) the role and function of these organizations as representatives of the Turkish population; (3) the methods and strategies that TMUOs use to influence the German policy and public in order to eliminate racism toward Turkish migrants; and (4) the possibilities available to them to promote antiracism in Germany. The article shows that many organizations were established because of social, economic, and political discrimination against TMs in Germany. It shows that TMUOs are involved in activities to support TM integration into the German society as well as in defensive moves to protect them from discrimination. My main argument is that TMUOs' efforts to support the integration of TMs into the German society have generally been ignored. These organizations are excluded in many cases from negotiations with the government and thus have limited impact on the growth of Turkish minority rights in Germany.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20628330,2008,International Journal of Sociology,10.2307_20628330
1,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL: AN EMPIRICAL TEST,"A number of hypotheses suggested by Blalock's discussion of competitive and pressure resources which minority groups can use to force occupational opportunities were tested with data from the professional basketball leagues. Specifically, we tested whether blacks had equal opportunity in professional basketball or whether only superior black performers were permitted to compete, and whether the discrimination of this form was negatively related to the number of blacks in the SMSAs in which professional teams were located. The data did not clearly support the hypothesis that only black ""stars"" were recruited and the second line positions were reserved for whites; however, there was evidence that mediocre white players remained in the league longer than mediocre black players. The proportion black in an SMSA had little effect on discrimination explaining for non-Southern cities only nine percent of the variation in the discrimination index.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20830874,1973,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20830874

Focusing on aspects of their working environment, this paper discusses ways inspectors have sought to organize daily activities. Faced with an uncertain decision-making process, lacking adequate preparation to deal with an unpredictable public, and working within a decentralized administrative structure, inspectors are nonetheless confronted by strong bureaucratic pressures for uniformity and consistency in their actions. Attempting to reconcile these conflicting demands, personnel have utilized various strategies for reducing overall risks associated with their work.

Respondents' attitudes were measured on the following topics: open housing, programs to integrate housing, interracial marriage, interracial social relations, segregated schools, busing, and explanations for the Blacks' inferior jobs, income, and housing. The results indicate that in areas of interpersonal relations and housing, teachers and educators do harbor prejudicial attitudes; however, educators are comparable to other professionals regarding these attitudes and less prejudiced than laborers, farmers, clerical workers, craftsmen, managers, and administrators. Within the teaching profession, kindergarten and elementary teachers appear slightly more racially prejudiced than secondary school teachers.

A path analysis indicates that two sets of protester-controlled factors decisively affect protest group success: organization and beliefs and goals. Of the two, beliefs and goals is the more significant, although bureaucracy is very important for recognition. For the most part, the impact of protester-controlled factors is not due to the reaction of third parties; however, revolutionary activism, one factor in the realm of beliefs and goals, is a notable exception. Revolutionary activism's negative association with success is largely due to suppression by third parties.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20831203,1981,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20831203
1,Reducing Occupational Sex Segregation: Explaining Failure and Success,"Recent developments in theory and public policy regarding occupational sex segregation are reviewed and evaluated. It is argued that the shift away from individual and sex role explanations and toward structural explanations is an important step forward. In particular, socialist feminist and labor market segmentation theories provide useful frameworks for understanding the obstacles to occupational integration. However, in order to understand both the failures and the successes of attempts to reduce segregation, a neo-Weberian conflict model is more fruitful. This model recognizes that social outcomes may reflect the power of capital or patriarchy, but they may also reflect sources of power and group interest which cut across those categories. The usefulness of this approach is illustrated through an examination of three empirical questions: 1) Why did the rate of sex segregation decline for the first time in the 1970's; 2) Why did segregation decline significantly more in some occupations than others; and 3) Why have corporate executives become more favorable in their attitudes toward affirmative action? Answers to these questions are sought by examining the role of state power and the groups which influence it, the interests of management at different levels of the organization, and the interests of union leaders and members.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20831459,1988,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20831459
1,"RELIGION AND THE QUEST FOR MEANING AND ORDER: OLD PARADIGMS, NEW REALITIES","Steven Warner's seminal paper identifying the emergence of a new paradigm in the sociology of religion is cautious in making claims beyond the United States. This paper presents both theoretical and empirical evidence that points to a more universal application. At the empirical level there is mounting evidence to indicate that religion is not on a trajectory leading to extinction as predicted by secularization theory. At the theoretical level, rational choice models provide a more efficacious explanation of the persistence of religion in the modern world. Rather, it challenges the ability of secularization theory to explain the persistence and character of religion. The paradigm debate has served to sharpen the secularization theory perspective, but the theory stands clearly in need of serious revamping if it is to survive.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20831724,1995,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20831724
1,ETHNIC COMPETITION FOR AN OCCUPATIONAL NICHE: THE CASE OF BLACK AND ITALIAN BARBERS IN NORTHERN U.S. CITIES DURING THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY,"Ethnic groups often compete for occupational niches that can lead to entrepreneurship in the mainstream economy. In the late nineteenth century, blacks and Italian immigrants in the urban North vied for a niche serving whites in barbering. Applying human ecology theory, I explore this rivalry, analyzing inter- and intra-group competition with data from the Census of 1900. As I hypothesized, black men were displaced from their barbering niche by competitive exclusion, i.e., their concentration in this niche was reduced by the entry of Italian men into the niche, and by niche saturation, i.e., the number of potential black entrants to the niche exceeded the niche's capacity to absorb them, exacerbating competition among black men for positions within the niche. Also as I hypothesized, Italian men, who ranked higher in the ethnic queue, were not inhibited by niche saturation and thus had greater opportunity to exploit their barbering niche. The analysis of this historical case of ethnic competition demonstrates that principles of human ecology can be used to draw general conclusions about the rivalries that occur between and within minority groups for valued occupational niches in the economic mainstream.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20832170,2002,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20832170
1,The Microlevel Discourse of Social Movement Framing: Debating Antiwar Protests on a University Listserv,"Over the past two decades, researchers have increasingly employed frame analysis in attempts to understand the genesis, development, and outcomes of social movements. Relatively little attention, however, has focused on the microlevel processes involved in generating social movement framews. This paper is an effort to link theories of social movement framing with the methodology of discourse analysis. In the following, an online debate over the legitimacy of protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States provides qualitative data for a discourse analysis of microlevel framing processes. The debate occurred on a university listserv and involved more than 100 messages offered by 67 individuals over 16 days. Analyses reveal four distinct framing contests in the discourse. An initiating contest regarding a specific antiwar protest is found to generate three additional contests, the first about antiwar protests more generally, the second about the war in Iraq itself, and the third about the appropriateness of holding such a debate on a listserve sent to university employees. A framing process schema is offered to represent conflict between social movement and countermovement participants across the discourse.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20832315,2007,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20832315
1,Small Groups and Culture Creation: The Idioculture of Little League Baseball Teams,"Following interactionist theory, this study argues that cultural creation and usage can be examined by conceptualizing cultural forms as originating in a small-group context. Those cultural elements which characterize an interacting group are termed the idioculture of the group. This approach focuses on the content of small-group interaction, and suggests that the meanings of cultural items in a small group must be considered in order to comprehend their continued existence as communication. Five characteristics of cultural items affect which items will become part of a group culture. Cultural forms may be created and continue to be utilized in situations if they are known to members of the interacting group, usable in the course of group interaction, functional in supporting group goals and individual needs, appropriate in supporting the status hierarchy of the group, and triggered by events which occur in group interaction. These elements have impact only through the interpretations of group members of their situations. Support for this approach is drawn from a participant observation study of Little League baseball teams.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2094525,1971,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2094525

1,Can Gender Inequalities be Reduced?,"Research demonstrates that sex or gender remains a powerful basis of inequality in the expectations and behavior of men and women in mixed-sex task groups. Drawing upon the work of Epstein (1970) and the theoretical apparatus of status characteristics theory (see Berger et al., 1977), we explore one means by which these inequalities may be reduced--the disconfirmation of established gender-based expectations. The results of two experiments--one involving females and one involving males--show that disconfirmation does in fact reduce tasks inequality for both women and men. The results also support predictions based on the combining and attenuation principles of status characteristics theory. We interpret these findings as demonstrating that sex role socialization is (1) a manifestation of a more general status organizing process and (2) more situationally specific than has previously been assumed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095477,1975,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2095477
1,"The Positional Power of American Labor, 1963-1977","This paper extends Perrone's conceptualization of positional power of labor and investigates its impact on three labor outcomes. We conceptualize positional power as embedded in the structural relations among interconnected spheres of production in the economy. We maintain that positional power is a three-dimensional construct. It entails (1) the ability of workers in a given industry to disrupt operations of other industries ""upstream"" in the production process, (2) the ability to disrupt operations ""downstream"" in the production process, and (3) the ability to disrupt production locally within their own industry. After developing new measures of these three dimensions from interindustry input-output flow matrices, we estimate the impact of positional power on three labor outcomes: (a) labor's organizational capacity, (b) labor militancy, and (c) labor's economic standing. Our findings suggest that positional power positively influences all three of these dimensions. We discuss the significance of these results for future research.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095790,1984,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2095790
1,"Status Incongruence among Boundary Spanners: Structure, Exchange, and Conflict","The exchange of resources and perceptions of conflict among professional planners is examined as a function of the relation between their structural positions. Analysis of dyadic relations at federal, regional, state, county, and municipal levels of government revealed that structural features interact to produce characteristic exchange flows, and the exchange of resources among these professionals affects perceptions of conflict. Professionals at higher levels of government were more likely than those at lower levels to do favors and provide information, particularly when they were more central in the professional network. However, these exchange patterns (favors and information) were associated with conflict in relationships. I interpret this as a result of status incongruence in dyads that match actors at higher levels of government but lower organizational positions with actors at higher organizational positions but lower levels of government.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095803,1978,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2095803
1,Relative Wages and the Radical Theory of Economic Segmentation,"The radical theory of economic segmentation holds that systems of labor control affect labor's capacity to pursue its interest. The system characteristic of the leading sectors of U.S. industry provides immediate benefits to workers at the cost of undermining their control over work and their ability to mobilize for collective action. The radical theory implies that the system initially increased wages but eventually led to a decline because of these long-term effects on control and organization. I examine wages in U.S. manufacturing industries between 1947 and 1987, first distinguishing groups of industries within which wages move together. Data on collective bargaining provisions are then used to verify that the resulting groups are related to systems of labor control. Regressions are fit for wage changes in each group and significant period differences are found in the core group. The pattern of parameter shifts supports the radical theory's predictions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095808,1978,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2095808
1,Local Industrial Dominance and Earnings Attainment,"Drawing on the ecological concept of local industrial dominance, we examine how the industrial distribution of the metropolitan labor force influences workers' earnings. Industrial dominance is defined as the proportional overrepresentation of the local labor force in a given industry or industrial sector. A contextual analysis of census microdata for the largest 125 SMSAs shows that, within industries and sectors, workers in metropolitan areas in which their industry is dominant have significantly higher earnings than workers in areas in which that industry is less dominant. These results hold for two different measures of dominance and four race/sex groups. The effects of local dominance on earnings appear stronger for industries in the core and state sectors, for financial, business and personal service functions, and for public administration. The influence of dominance is partly explained by the tendency of locally dominant industries to be composed of larger establishments.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095809,1986,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2095809
1,"After Minimalism: Transformations of State Bar Associations from Market Dependence to State Reliance, 1918 to 1950","Compared to conventional approaches, we conceptualize transformations in populations of organizations in terms of shifts in their relative embeddedness in markets and states. As organizations expand beyond minimalist conditions of existence, states and markets offer alternative solutions to the core problems of persistence: obtaining resources, managing competition, and constructing legitimacy. By analyzing the movers and stayers in a population of state bar associations that split into two co-existing forms of organization--one primarily reliant on the market and the other primarily dependent on the state--we demonstrate that a two-stage transition to a new form can be explained by the complementary interplay of resource dependency and neo-institutional theories. Organizations are more likely to move from reliance on the market to reliance on the state if (1) their market performance has been unsuccessful, (2) states are willing and able to solve organizational problems, (3) organizations are younger and less established, and (4) compelling alternative models have been propagated by moral entrepreneurs and adopted by influential states.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096074,1988,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096074
1,The Concept of Mode of Exchange,"The neoclassical economic concept of the market fails to consider social relations and structures. I present a sociological concept of ""mode of exchange"" as an alternative and distinguish four modes of exchange based on whether trade is open to popular participation and whether trade is primarily within a region or across regions. The social structural conditions that underlie each mode of exchange include the level of stratification and political centralization. The power struggle among groups for control over trade, rather than individual utility maximization, is a critical factor in commercial development. I apply this framework to commercial development of England and Japan.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096098,1975,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096098
1,Social Networks and Organizational Dynamics,"In this paper we develop and test a theory of the dynamic behavior of voluntary groups. The theory combines an image of social network structure with the concept of natural selection to model changes in group composition over time. We consider the group to be a population of members subject to natural selection in sociodemographic space. According to the theory, the probability that members will enter or leave the group depends upon the number and strength of social network ties that connect group members to each other and to nonmembers. We analyze an event history dataset constructed from interviews using the Life History Calendar method and information on ego-centered social networks developed from the General Social Survey Network Module. We test the hypothesis that network connections inside a group are associated with reduced membership turnover, while connections outside the group increase turnover. We find that weak ties and network connections that span greater distances in sociodemographic space are positively correlated with leaving current groups and joining new ones. We conclude that weak ties are a major source of change in group composition.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096202,1984,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096202
1,Survival Chances of Newly Founded Business Organizations,"Human capital theory and organizational ecology offer a comprehensive set of factors that influence the mortality of newly formed business organizations. Human capital theory identifies individual characteristics of the founder as important prerequisites for survival. Organizational ecology emphasizes organizational characteristics and environmental conditions. We test basic hypotheses derived from both theories using retrospective data from a survey of 1,849 business founders in Germany. Organizational characteristics, especially number of employees and amount of capital invested, and organizational strategies, especially businesses aiming at a national market, are the most important determinants of business survival. The human capital characteristics of the founder, especially years of schooling and work experience and industry-specific experience, show strong direct and indirect effects as well.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096207,1991,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096207
1,"Multiple Networks and Mobilization in the Paris Commune, 1871","Although sociologists increasingly recognize the importance of networks in social movement mobilization, efforts to understand network factors have been hampered by the operationalization of network factors as individual-level variables. I argue that disaggregating relational data into individual-level counts of social ties obscures the crucial issues of network structure and multiplexity. I analyze data on insurgency in the Paris Commune of 1871 and show that organizational networks and pre-existing informal networks interacted in the mobilization process, even in the final moments of the insurrection. Network autocorrelation models reveal that enlistment patterns in the Paris National Guard created organizational linkages among residential areas that contributed to solidarity in the insurgent effort, but the efficacy of these linkages depended on the presence of informal social ties rooted in Parisian neighborhoods. Thus the role of network factors can only be understood by studying the joint influence of formal and informal social structures on the mobilization process.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096251,1980,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096251
1,Employment Relations and the Labor Market: Integrating Institutional and Market Perspectives,"From a market perspective, workers' access to bureaucratic personnel structures at work is related to the transferability of their occupational skills. An institutional perspective emphasizes ""normative and coercive"" factors like union power, establishment size, occupational status, and extent of government employment. Building on these two perspectives, we examine the impact of an occupation's external market--the extent to which it offers systematic within-occupation movement among employers--on internal job mobility and protection structures and the availability of grievance procedures. Data from a sample of Chicago workers and their employers confirm aspects of both market and institutional theory. Results also support our core hypothesis, that incumbents of occupations embedded in strong external markets are less likely to have these governance structures available.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096253,1985,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096253

The predictions of the model hold for each country. We also seek to clarify processes of legitimation and competition by considering multiple levels of analysis and links between countries. Our main hypothesis is that legitimation operates more broadly than competition. In particular, legitimation is driven by the density of all European automobile producers, while competition is determined by a country's own density of producers. This hypothesis is supported for the four continental countries but not for Britain.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096291,1990,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096291

I propose a discrete-time hazard-rate model to explain this novel pattern of labor disorganization.

If so, what explains the relationship between organization size and job rewards? We examine these questions using a recent nationally representative data set that provides information on organizations and their employees in the United States. We find that employees in large organizations have higher earnings, more fringe benefits and opportunities for promotion, but less autonomy on the job than do workers employed by small organizations. Our theoretical framework identifies several possible reasons for the relationship between organization size and job rewards, including industrial, geographic, organizational, and individual variables. Whether a firm has internal labor markets is the correlate of organization size most consistently related to job rewards.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096406,1992,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096406

1,Team Nursing: Professional Coordination or Bureaucratic Control?,"Nursing teams are conceptualized as coordination mechanisms that respond to task interdependence within the hospital unit. The form of coordination is predicted to result from organizational decision makers' conceptions of the work to be performed as well as the more objective characteristics of the work. The effects of these technological variables on coordination are mediated by the size of the unit and the degree of professionalism exhibited by the nursing staff. A path model is constructed and tested using a sample of 146 patient care units from a national sample of 17 hospitals. In general, the results are supportive of the model: both conceptions of a task and task predictability (or known technology) appear to affect coordination through other structural characteristics of the unit. On larger units the nursing team provides a hierarchical control mechanism, whereas teaming in units characterized by greater staff professionalism provide a means of lateral coordination as well as hierarchical control.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136391,1982,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_2136391

Results of studies comparing employed women, employed men, and housewives have been mixed, however, and investigators have begun to consider additional explanatory factors. This paper focuses on a potential source of gender differences in distress that has received relatively little attention: the workplace itself. I consider the extent to which work conditions and the sexual segregation of occupations are related to two measures of distress: demoralization, which is more prevalent among women, and drinking, which is more prevalent among men. Multiple regression analyses indicate that the only work-related factors associated with demoralization are substantive complexity and full-time work, and these have an effect among women only. Full-time work and low levels of complexity are associated with higher levels of demoralization among women. Substantive complexity is also associated with drinking, but only among men; as complexity declines, levels of drinking increase. These findings indicate the importance of considering work-related factors and measures of distress associated differentially with gender when investigating gender differences in distress.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136847,1976,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_2136847

1,Ownership Organization and Firm Performance,"This essay reviews research on the type and degree of fragmentation of firm ownership with an emphasis on the consequences of ownership organization for firm performance. We use a property rights approach to synthesize sociological, organizational, legal, and economic research that has examined the effect of ownership organization on firm performance. Agency theorists generally assume that shareholders are homogenous and that their influence on firm performance is directly proportional to the percentage of equity they hold. However, empirical research following this approach has failed to produce definitive evidence. Class analysis perspectives interpret these inconclusive results as demonstrating that, regardless of ownership organization, firms are run to serve the capitalist class. An alternative interpretation is that shareholders are not homogeneous but that certain types of shareholders use their formal authority, social influence, and expertise to ""capture"" property rights and strongly influence firm performance. The influence of different types of owners may depend on industry characteristics, and we review literature pointing to a contingency theory of ownership organization.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/223500,1999,Annual Review of Sociology,10.2307_223500

During this period, inequality in hourly wages increased by over 40 percent. We report a decomposition, relating rising inequality to the union wage distribution's shrinking weight. We argue that unions helped institutionalize norms of equity, reducing the dispersion of nonunion wages in highly unionized regions and industries. Accounting for unions' effect on union and nonunion wages suggests that the decline of organized labor explains a fifth to a third of the growth in inequality—an effect comparable to the growing stratification of wages by education.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23019206,2011,American Sociological Review,10.2307_23019206

1,Understanding the Patient-Physician Interaction: Potential for Reducing Health Disparities,"Racial differences in health and health care persist. These differences can be linked, in part, to physician-patient communication. This study examined the effect of race concordance and communication comfort on the patient's level of general satisfaction and their intent to adhere to physician instructions. Results indicate that patient satisfaction and likelihood of adherence are related to communication comfort. Additionally, patients seeing a physician of their own race are more likely to adhere to instructions than those seeing a physician of a different race, although the effect of race-concordance is not as strong as communication comfort. Interestingly, race-concordance is not related to patient satisfaction. We conclude that both communication comfort and race-concordance play major roles in the patient-physician relationship. Given that communication comfort appears to play a more important role than race concordance, our findings suggest that increasing awareness of racial differences and effective communication can increase patient satisfaction and adherence intent. Increasing adherence with treatment regimes should increase positive health outcomes.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23548744,2008,Journal of Applied Social Science,10.2307_23548744

1,The Production and Transmission of Knowledge in Colonial Malaya,"This article aims to highlight how knowledge played an integral role in the cultural reconstruction of the Malay world during the colonial period. The British produced knowledge about the Malays through scholarly writings in history books and the creation of the census report. This knowledge was, for the most part, constructed and did not necessarily correspond to the social reality of the Malays. The education system played a vital role in transmitting this knowledge to the masses, thus beginning a process of internalisation on their part. This led to a rapid disintegration of Malay cultural practices and way of life as they comprehended alien Western concepts, such as history, territory and community. The nationalist movement in present day Malaysia with its emphasis on race and boundaries attests to the degree to which the British has succeeded in transforming the identity of the Malays. The core of this paper is aimed at demonstrating the connection between British administrative procedures and its impact in reconstructing the thought patterns of the people. This permanent invasion upon the minds of the Malays can be said to the most lasting legacy of British colonial rule.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23655208,2009,Asian Journal of Social Science,10.2307_23655208
1,"Racial formation, environmental racism, and the emergence of Silicon Valley","The environmental justice literature is characterized by a strange fact: the vast majority of research on this topic is about racial inequality, yet there is almost no mention of social scientific theories of race and racism. It is as if statistical correlations alone are enough to prove or disprove the existence of racism. While there are exceptions to this rule, the overwhelming majority of environmental justice studies make no mention of well-established theoretical frameworks on racism from the social sciences. This article is an effort to place the problem of environmental racism/inequality in the broader context of sociological theories of racism. To that end we focus on the theory of racial formation — specifically the concept of racial projects — and extend this model to the question of environmental racism. By applying this theoretical framework to the case of immigrants and people of color in Silicon Valley, we argue that institutional racism — as is the case with environmental racism — is a complex set of practices supported by the linked exploitation of people and natural resources. We draw on both the discursive and material/structural practices of racial projects in Silicon Valley's long history of environmental and social justice struggles to illustrate how environmental racism functions within a racial formation framework.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23889372,2004,Ethnicities,10.2307_23889372
1,The educational attainment of the second generation in Germany: Social origins and ethnic inequality,"Using the German Microcensus, we study second-generation immigrants' educational attainment in Germany, focusing on the descendants of classic labour migrants. Our results show that educational outcomes in terms of attending or completing the highest schooling track leading to the Abitur vary considerably among different ethnic groups. Second-generation young adults, in particular Turks and Italians, experience pronounced disadvantages in comparison to their German peers. The central question in this context is to what extent ethnic stratification in the German school system is related to educational and social background. Our findings suggest that ethnic disadvantages primarily result from social rather than from specific ethnic inequalities, since initial differences in the chances of attaining the Abitur disappear after considering educational and social origin, the only exception being Italian young adults.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23889512,2007,Ethnicities,10.2307_23889512
1,"""White Backlash"", 'Unfairness' and Justifications of British National Party (BNP) Support","In 2005, Roger Hewitt published White Backlash and the Politics of Multiculturalism. Using qualitative research conducted in Greenwich, London and via an engagement with political and media discourses, he traced the emergence of a new theme within white racism. This article will outline the origins and development of 'white backlash', from Conservative MP Enoch Powell's infamous 'Rivers of Blood' speech in 1968 through Thatcherism, and examine the re-emergence of notions of 'unfairness' to whites as a result of the actions of both New Labour and the British National Party (BNP). Using qualitative interviews with BNP voters in Burnley, Lancashire, England, the way in which individuals sought to 'justify' their actions with recourse to notions of 'unfairness' and 'equality' will be examined. It will be suggested that BNP supporters viewed multiculturalism and its perceived allies, positive discrimination and political correctness, to be the harbingers of a policy that institutionalized the exclusion of white residents.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23890858,2010,Ethnicities,10.2307_23890858

1,Are Informal Connections a Functional Alternative to Associational Life in Enhancing Social Cohesion? Findings from Hong Kong,"This article aims to ascertain whether organizational life and informal connections, which made up part of Putnam's (Bowling alone: the collapse and revival of American community. Simon & Schuster, New York, 2000) Social Capital Index, have separate effects on social cohesion. Postulating that informal gatherings with family and friends might be a functional alternative to associational life, we employed multiple regression analysis to test the hypothesis. The analysis was based on a 2011 territory-wide door-to-door survey in Hong Kong. Controlling for the effects of demographic variables including gender, age, educational level, and employment status, it was found that formal participation in organizations contributed significantly to the explanation in five of the eight subindexes of social cohesion. In contrast, informal connections contributed significantly only to one subindex. The pattern persisted when attitudinal variables such as life satisfaction, social support, and perceived social class were added to the regression analysis. In short, our analysis demonstrated that participation in formal organizations fosters various aspects of social cohesion, and that this effect cannot be replaced by informal gatherings with family and friends.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24721456,2014,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_24721456
1,Brokers and the Earnings of Female Sex Workers in India,"This study examines whether working with a broker increases or reduces the payment received for the last client among female sex workers. Building on research on the informal economy and sex work, we formulate a positive embeddedness hypothesis, expecting a positive association, and an exploitation hypothesis, expecting a negative association. We analyze a large survey combined with intensive interview data on female sex workers in Andhra Pradesh, India. These data uniquely distinguish between the amount the sex worker actually received and the amount the client paid. The analyses show that brokers are associated with significantly lower last payment received. Although brokers are associated with a greater number of clients in the past week, this does not result in significantly higher total earnings in the past week. Further analyses suggest that much of the negative relationship with earnings is due to the fact that brokers lead to a lack of control over the amount clients are charged. At the same time, the results fail to show that brokers actually provide services of value. Ultimately, the results support the exploitation hypothesis. We conclude by encouraging the refinement of theories of embeddedness and exploitation and calling for greater research on workers in the informal economy of developing countries.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24756411,2015,American Sociological Review,10.2307_24756411
1,"Pulling Closer and Moving Apart: Interaction, Identity, and Influence in the U.S. Senate, 1973 to 2009","This article reconciles two seemingly incompatible expectations about interpersonal interaction and social influence. One theoretical perspective predicts that an increase in interaction between two actors will promote subsequent convergence in their attitudes and behaviors, whereas another view anticipates divergence. We examine the role of political identity in moderating the effects of interaction on influence. Our investigation takes place in the U.S. Senate—a setting in which actors forge political identities for public consumption based on the external constraints, normative obligations, and reputational concerns they face. We argue that interaction between senators who share the same political identity will promote convergence in their voting behavior, whereas interaction between actors with opposing political identities will lead to divergence. Moreover, we theorize that the consequences of political identity for interpersonal influence depend on the local interaction context. Political identity's effects on influence will be greater in more divided Senate committees than in less divided ones. We find support for these hypotheses in analyses of data, spanning over three decades, on voting behavior, interaction, and political identity in the Senate. These findings contribute to research on social influence; elite integration and political polarization; and identity theory.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24756705,2015,American Sociological Review,10.2307_24756705
1,Agricultural Advisors as Climate Information Intermediaries:,"Although agricultural production faces chronic stress associated with extreme precipitation events, high temperatures, drought, and shifts in climate conditions, adoption of climate information into agricultural decision making has been relatively limited. Agricultural advisors have been shown to play important roles as information intermediaries between scientists and farmers, brokering, translating, and adding value to agronomic and economic information of use in agricultural management decision making. Yet little is known about the readiness of different types of agricultural advisors to use weather and climate information to help their clients manage risk under increasing climate uncertainty. More than 1700 agricultural advisors in four midwestern states (Nebraska, Indiana, Iowa, and Michigan) completed a web-based survey during the spring of 2012 about their use of weather and climate information, public or private sector employment, and roles as information intermediaries in three advising specializations: agronomic, conservation, and financial. Key findings reveal that advisors who specialize in providing agronomic information are positively inclined toward acting as weather and climate information intermediaries, based on influence and willingness to use climate information in providing many types of operational and tactical advice. Advisors who provide conservation advice appear to be considering weather and climate information when providing tactical and strategic land-use advice, but advisors who provide financial advice seem less inclined to act as climate information intermediaries. These findings highlight opportunities to increase the capacity of different types of advisors to enable them to be effective weather and climate information intermediaries.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24907419,2015,"Weather, Climate, and Society",10.2307_24907419
1,"Sports in Civil Society: Networks, Social Capital and Influence","Sports represent the largest category of voluntary organizations in many European countries. This article addresses questions concerning the position, centrality and influence of sports organizations as one specific part of civil society, and is based on an approach providing information on networks between categories of organizations. These networks consist of overlapping affiliations to organizations which are then interpreted as structures making communication, persuasion and influence possible. From these networks, position, centrality and potential influence of sports organizations in civil society are analysed. The article also looks more specifically at the links between sports and seven other types of voluntary organizations. The data is based on Norwegian surveys from 1982, 1990, and 2003, providing the possibility to follow sports organizations over a period of 20 years. The results show that sports organizations are influential due to size, but relatively weakly embedded and positioned in civil society. This position is, however, strengthened compared to most other organizations during the last 20 years. Regarding the relation of sports to other specific organizations some type of 'normalization' seems to have taken place, and sports are socially 'closer' to most organizations in 2003 than in 1982.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25209140,2008,European Sociological Review,10.2307_25209140
1,"Prison and Democracy: Lessons Learned and Not Learned, from 1989 to 2009","Dostoevsky, Mandela, and others have long noted that prisons expose social realities, often hidden, particularly inequality and gaps between policy and practice. Prisons symbolize, mirror, and shape the communities and countries in which they exist. Although prisons informed and were intertwined with many of the defining moments of 1989, in the 20 years since, societies often failed to recognize the important role prison and punishment play in relationship to democracy. By not recognizing that ""prison matters"" in relationship to democracy, polities (whether in transition to democracy or established democracies) failed to adequately learn ""prison lessons."" Starting with a case study of South Africa, this paper considers prisons during apartheid and under democratic governance. This case is connected to other comparative and international examples (including Russia, Brazil, and the USA) to identify five lessons learned and not learned concerning prison and democracy. First, policies and practices of imprisonment reflect social orders, especially structures of inequality and understandings of legitimate power and opposition. Second, countries transitioning to democracy seldom anticipate rising crime and invariably neglect the relevance of prisons. Third, nations do not adequately grapple with the role of prison in the past, especially the nondemocratic past. Fourth, in established and recent democracies, penal populism resulted as politicians defined prison as a solution to a host of social ills, ignoring the consequences of expanded punishment. Fifth, prisons shaped key substantive realities beyond their walls, from leadership to recidivism, scandals, fiscal deficits, and crises of legitimacy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25621933,2009,"International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society",10.2307_25621933

We propose that an organizational approach to the study of stratification should examine status-and class-based inequalities at the intersection of (a) the inertial tendencies of organizational structure, logic, and practice; (b) the relative power of actors within workplaces; and (c) organizations' institutional and competitive environments. The interplay of these generic forces either reproduces static practices and structures or leads to dynamic processes of change.

While these trends have continued elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia has experienced the reintroduction of strong political and ideological controls in social and economic life. This has created a ""crisis of legitimacy,"" which the regime attempts to overcome through the delivery of increasing levels of personal consumption. Ethnic and political tensions, however, threaten the current status quo, while economic problems increasingly provide a focus for tension. It appears likely that the Soviet Union will have to introduce some ""loosening"" innovations in the future in order to contain these tensions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2577676,1976,Social Forces,10.2307_2577676

An Empirical Test of Kanter's Theory of Proportions,"Kanter's argument that relative numbers shape perception and social interaction and that observed sex differences in groups may be attributable to the fact that women usually form a small proportion of the membership was tested empirically in relation to union workers' committees. The dynamics of boundary heightening, role entrapment and power differences were significantly more pronounced in skewed than in balanced committees, supporting Kanter's contention. Changes in group sex proportion, however, had a stronger impact on stereotypical views of women than of men. Furthermore, while structure had a moderating effect, sex was still found to have a main effect on the relationship between sex ratios and the dependent variables.

Students of inequality tend to reject this conjecture on the strength of consistent findings showing that the minority earnings level is negatively related to its group size. A valid test of the minority power hypothesis requires an organizational analysis where a distinction can be made between (1) minority size and (2) minority share in managerial positions. We examined these two effects on wage inequality between females and males as well as between blacks and whites in 117 work organizations. For reasons specified in the article we cannot conclude that the findings lend support to the minority power argument.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2579969,1987,Social Forces,10.2307_2579969

1,Nonconformity in Competitive Repertoires: A Sociological View of Markets,"A sociological framework is proposed for studying nonconformity in competitive repertoires. We argue that the extensiveness and continuity of a company's market interactions very much influence its level of nonconformity. Market-level factors that might influence nonconformity include customer and competitor diversity and the continuity of traditions; and firm-level factors include the size, resources, and industry experience of an organization. Nonconformity may also be driven by economic factors such as market growth and financial returns. Most of these sources of nonconformity were confirmed in a study of the competitive repertoires of the major U.S. airlines. The findings also show that competitive nonconformity was associated with subsequent declines in financial performance, but mainly for smaller airlines with homogeneous markets. This study supported some central notions from the sociology of markets and, with qualification, from institutional theory.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580349,1984,Social Forces,10.2307_2580349

1,Measuring the Composition of Voluntary Groups: A Multitrait-Multimethod Analysis,"Data on a sample of 128 face-to-face voluntary groups are analyzed with the multitrait-multimethod approach. The traits measured include four characteristics: size, sex composition, age composition, and educational composition. These four traits are measured with three different methods: reports from a respondent chosen through a probability sample from the community, reports from an official of the group, and estimates from direct measurement of the traits at an organizational meeting. Results of the analysis suggest that the three measures are parallel with one another in the sense of Lord and Novick 1968. This result means that the three methods are equally desirable. Surprisingly, the direct canvass measure does not appear to be more reliable than the others; on the contrary, it appears to be equivalent to other reports for the traits measured. There is a slight suggestion in the data that officials in the group are more accurate than ordinary respondents in reporting information about less salient characteristics of the members, such as years of education. In general, the three methods of gathering data appear to be equally reliable, although they measure slightly different aspects of group composition.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580559,1991,Social Forces,10.2307_2580559

1,Why Not Ascription? Organizations' Employment of Male and Female Managers,"We examine the effects of organizations' employment practices on sex-based ascription in managerial jobs. Given men's initial preponderance in management, we argue that inertia, sex labels, and power dynamics predispose organizations to use sex-based ascription when staffing managerial jobs, but that personnel practices can invite or curtail ascription. Our results-based on data from a national probability sample of 516 work organizations-show that specific personnel practices affect the sexual division of managerial labor. Net of controls for the composition of the labor supply, open recruitment methods are associated with women holding a greater share of management jobs, while recruitment through informal networks increases men's share. Formalizing personnel practices reduces men's share of management jobs, especially in large establishments, presumably because formalization checks ascription in job assignments, evaluation, and factors that affect attrition. Thus, through their personnel practices, establishments license or limit ascription.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657438,1996,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657438
1,"The Market That Antitrust Built: Public Policy, Private Coercion, and Railroad Acquisitions, 1825 to 1922","How do new business models emerge? Neoinstitutionalists argue that the process often begins when a policy shift undermines the status quo; groups then vie to define the best alternative. The authors explore the role of power in selecting between two alternative business models available to railroads from 1897, when antitrust laws banned the cartel-the prevailing model for managing competition. Predatory railroads prescribed several methods for destroying rivals. Financiers prescribed amicable mergers instead, and fought predation by threatening to withhold capital from predators. An analysis of the 167 rail acquisitions in Massachusetts between 1825 and 1922 confirms that the financiers succeeded. After antitrust laws were enforced, railroads left cartels to follow the business model of financiers rather than that of predators. This can be seen in the conditional variables that predict buying and selling. Thus public policy and power can shape key market features. It is ironic that this market, built by antitrust, became the prototype for the neoliberal ideal of the unregulated economy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657540,1980,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657540
1,Organizational Ecology and Job Mobility,"The outside opportunity structure is important in predicting the likelihood and direction of job change but has received little attention. We view the ecology of organizations as a determinant of worker expectations of outside opportunity and connect characterizations of organizational size diversity and inequality with job matching and firm reputation theory on how worker expectations are affected by organizational characteristics. This leads to the predictions that greater organizational diversity and inequality within a sector of the labor market will cause more intrasector job changes and fewer intersector job changes. We test these predictions on intra- and interindustrial and regional job changes, yielding supportive results on both industrial and geographical job mobility. Comparison of the results suggests stronger evidence in favor of reputation than matching theory.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2675509,1984,Social Forces,10.2307_2675509

To represent the complexity of women's work trajectories during young adulthood, we develop a conceptual framework that depicts a broad range of work activity profiles. Empirical results obtained using the NLSY show that three aspects of early experience influence mature women's labor force attachment, namely the amount of experience accumulated; the timing of work experience; and the volatility of that experience. Above and beyond these experience measures, we also find that background factors influence adult women's attachment to the market.

1,Intersections of Power and Privilege: Long-Term Trends in Managerial Representation,"This article examines post–Civil Rights Act trends in private sector managerial representation for white men, white women, black men, and black women. We examine how three factors affect changing access to managerial positions: (1) industrial restructuring, (2) the process of bottom-up ascription, and (3) organizational characteristics. Accounting for compositional shifts in the labor supply, we find that white male managerial overrepresentation remains virtually unchanged since 1966, even while other status groups make gains. A significant portion of the observed equal opportunity advance for women and blacks takes place in the expanding service sectors of the economy. We also find that female and minority gains are enhanced in larger and more managerially intensive workplaces. For all groups, managerial representation is increasingly tied to the presence of similar others in nonmanagerial jobs. Further examination reveals a new status hierarchy of managers and subordinates—a hierarchy wherein white men are likely to manage men of all races. White women, in comparison, are realizing a growing racial privilege in managing women of color.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27736095,2009,American Sociological Review,10.2307_27736095

Voluntary organizations lose fastest those members who are either atypical of the group (the niche edge hypothesis) or subject to competition from other groups (the niche overlap hypotheis). The authors analyze an event-history data set, generated by the life-history calendar approach, of 2,813 voluntary association membership pells.

Kornai's theory of soft budbet constraints, born of the failure of earlier Hungarian reforms, fosters such skepticism-but it assumes as fixed organizational characteristics that in fact vary widely across government jurisdictions. Local governments with smaller industrial bases have clearer financial incentives and constraints, fewer nonfinancial interests in enterprises, and a greater capacity to monitor them. In China's vast public sector, the fastest growth in output and productivity has occurred where government ownership rights are clearest and most easily enforced, which enables officials to manage public industry as a diversified market-oriented firm.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2782429,1995,American Journal of Sociology,10.2307_2782429
1,Embeddedness and the Intellectual Projects of Economic Sociology,"In this review, we explore how the concept of embeddedness has shaped—and been shaped by—the evolution of the subfield of economic sociology. Although embeddedness is often taken as a conceptual umbrella for a single, if eclectic, approach to the sociological study of the economy, we argue that in fact the concept references two distinct intellectual projects. One project, following from Granovetter's (1985) well-known programmatic statement, attempts to discern the relational bases of social action in economic contexts. Another project, drawing from Polanyi's [1944 (2001), 1957, 1977] social theory, concerns the integration of the economy into broader social systems. Critically, these two formulations of embeddedness involve different views of the relationship between the economic and the social. The implication is that the obstacles to theoretical integration in economic sociology, while not insurmountable, are greater than is typically acknowledged.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/29737761,2007,Annual Review of Sociology,10.2307_29737761

1,"Networks, Race, and Hiring","It is common for scholars interested in race and poverty to invoke a lack of access to job networks as one of the reasons that African Americans and Hispanics face difficulties in the labor market. Much research has found, however, that minorities do worse when they use personal networks in job finding. Research in this area has been hampered by the complicated and multi-step nature of the job-finding process and by the lack of appropriate comparison data for demonstrating the various ways in which minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities. We seek to specify what it means to say that minorities are cut off from job networks. Building on the literature on social networks in the labor market, we delineate the various mechanisms by which minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities. We examine how these mechanisms operate, using unique data on the chain of network contacts that funnel to an employer offering desirable jobs. We find that network factors operate at several stages of the recruitment process. We find scant evidence, however, that these network factors serve to cut off minorities from employment in this setting. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and methodological implications of the case for the study of networks, race, and hiring.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038975,2006,American Sociological Review,10.2307_30038975
1,"Documenting Desegregation: Segregation in American Workplaces by Race, Ethnicity, and Sex, 1966-2003","Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act made employment discrimination and segregation on the basis of race, ethnicity, or sex illegal in the United States. Previous research based on analyses of aggregate national trends in occupational segregation suggests that sex and race/ethnic employment segregation has declined in the United States since the 1960s. We add to the existing knowledge base by documenting for the first time male-female, black-white, and Hispanic-white segregation trends using private sector workplace data. The general pattern is that segregation declined for all three categorical comparisons between 1966 and 1980, but after 1980 only sex segregation continued to decline markedly. We estimate regression-based decompositions in the time trends for workplace desegregation to determine whether the observed changes represent change in segregation behavior at the level of workplaces or merely changes in the sectoral and regional distribution of workplaces with stable industrial or local labor market practices. These decompositions suggest that, in addition to desegregation caused by changes in the composition of the population of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission monitored private sector firms, there has been real workplace-level desegregation since 1964.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/30039010,2006,American Sociological Review,10.2307_30039010
1,The Emergence and Decline of the Cuban Popular Tribunals,"Cuban popular courts have been a subject of widespread interest among Western scholars. This paper analyzes the factors which led to the development of this judicial experiment as well as the reasons for its demise. The success or failure of this experiment was closely tied to long-term economic and political goals of the Cuban government, which eventually came to require an institutionalized bureaucratic cadre to operate its judicial system. This shift doomed the popular courts and led to the emergence of the legal profession as one of the most influential groups within Cuban society.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3053489,1973,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3053489

Since the same technique was used 20 years earlier, the research sheds light on the extent to which the constituencies of elite Chicago lawyers have changed. The network is organized in three principal sectors-liberals, trial lawyers, and corporate lawyers. The structure implies a lack of integration within the bar. Minorities and women are now more widely dispersed across the segments of the network than they were in 1975, but they still have relatively few connections in the corporate sector of the bar.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3054042,1997,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3054042
1,"Convictability and Discordant Locales: Reproducing Race, Class, and Gender Ideologies in Prosecutorial Decisionmaking","Using ethnographic data, I examine prosecutors' discourse on case convictability (the likelihood of a guilty verdict at trial) in sexual assault cases. The analysis shows how prosecutors construct discordant locales through their categorization of victims, defendants, jurors, and their communities and the location of crime incidents. It demonstrates how prosecutors use discordant locales to justify case rejection. By ascribing stereotypical characteristics of a neighborhood to victims, defendants, and jurors, prosecutors construct distinct groups with different cultures who live in geographically separate spaces and have different schemes through which they interpret the everyday world. To construct discordant locale categorizations, prosecutors employ race, class, and gender imagery. Through this imagery they construct multiple normative standards of moral character of persons and of places. I argue that through the categorizations of place as discordant locales, prosecutors inadvertently reproduce race, class, and gender ideologies in legal decisionmaking. I conclude with policy suggestions for expanding and equalizing citizens' access to justice.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3054045,1997,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3054045
1,Merchants of Law as Moral Entrepreneurs: Constructing International Justice from the Competition for Transnational Business Disputes,"Over the past 20 years, international commercial arbitration has been transformed and institutionalized as the leading contractual method for the resolution of transnational commercial disputes. It has become an important institution of the growing international market. Although the process is far from unidirectional, this work of social construction can be described as a rationalization in the Weberian sense and also as an ""Americanization"" that has permitted U.S. litigators to shape the rules to favor their adversarial skills and approaches. An informal justice system has come increasingly to resemble ""off-shore litigation."" Drawing on Bourdieu's analytical tool of the legal ""field"" and, in particular, using the notion of an ""international legal field,"" this case study reveals how the continuing competition for business and for legitimacy-between civil law and common law, ""grand old men"" and ""technocrats,"" academics and practitioners-constructs and transforms the system of (international private) justice. As is true generally with respect to law, the details of the competition serve to build the careers of practitioners, to develop the area of practice, and to produce and legitimate the relevant ""law.""",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3054053,1995,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3054053

Borrowing from organizational theory the metaphor of loose coupling, a characteristic of many American political institutions, this article explores the tension between elements of loose and tight coupling within the sponsoring organization of judges (the bench) and the consequences of that tension for the distribution of services to clients of trial courts. The article identifies three sets of consequences: (1) The locus and style of innovation is acutely circumscribed by these tensions; in the court that is studied, assertive leadership and punctuated change are less likely than conciliar leadership and incremental change. (2) The juxtaposition of loosely and tightly coupled elements promote responsiveness to powerful clientele interests. (3) Responsiveness to powerful clientele interests leads to a distribution of resources that short-changes less influential clients of the court.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3054093,1997,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3054093
1,Integrating Models of Diffusion of Innovations: A Conceptual Framework,"This chapter provides a conceptual framework for integrating the array of variables defined in diffusion research to explicate their influence on an actor's decision to adopt an innovation. The framework groups the variables into three major components. The first component includes characteristics of the innovation itself, within which two sets of variables are defined concerning public versus private consequences and benefits versus costs of adoption. A second component involves the characteristics of innovators (actors) that influence the probability of adoption of an innovation. Within this component six sets of variables concern societal entity of innovators (either people, organizations, states, etc.), familiarity with the innovation, status characteristics, socioeconomic characteristics, position in social networks, and personal qualities. The third component involves characteristics of the environmental context that modulate diffusion via structural characteristics of the modern world. These latter characteristics incorporate four sets of variables: geographical settings, societal culture, political conditions, and global uniformity. The concluding analysis highlights the need in diffusion research to incorporate more fully (a) the interactive character of diffusion variables, (b) the gating function of diffusion variables, and (c) effects of an actor's characteristics on the temporal rate of diffusion.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3069244,2002,Annual Review of Sociology,10.2307_3069244
1,Citizenship and Gender in Work Organization: Some Considerations for Theories of the Labor Process,"Recent analyses of changes in the organization of work and authority relations have stimulated a concern for extending and elaborating a theory of the labor process under capitalism.

It is argued in this paper, however, that their works do not go far enough in connecting issues of race, gender, and citizenship (political inequality) with structures of control over the labor process. An analysis of data from a case study of the labor process in an agribusiness (lettuce) industry is employed to highlight the importance of citizenship and gender as statuses constructed external to economic organizations but applied internal to them. Three principal arguments are derived from that case study: (1) that differences in citizenship status and gender serve to distinguish among labor market participants; (2) that nonmarket processes affect not only the distribution of individuals into positions in the labor process but also provide distinct advantages to employers in the creation and maintenance of different labor processes; and (3) that citizenship and gender have a material basis external to the labor process, that is, they are not simply labels attached to workers.

1,How the Civil Rights Movement Revitalized Labor Militancy,"Can newly ascendant social movements revitalize the militant culture of older, institutionalized movements? Recent studies have focused on relations between new ascendant social movements like the civil rights, women's, and peace movements that emerged during the postwar cycle of protest, and therefore have been unable to address this question. Focusing on revitalization as a qualitatively different form of intermovement relation, the authors examine the possibility that civil rights movement insurgencies and organizations revitalized workplace labor militancy during the postwar decades. Time-series models show that the civil rights movement fueled an expanded militant worker culture that challenged management and sometimes union leadership. However, this revitalization of labor militancy was contingent on institutional context (stronger in the public sector than the private sector) and form of insurgent action (protests, riots, organizations) differentially embedded in historical phases (civil rights versus Black Power) of movement development. Theoretical implications for the study of social movements, industrial relations, and class conflict are discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088915,1986,American Sociological Review,10.2307_3088915

Data drawn from a triangulated ethnography of a single community mediation center suggest that community mediation centers come to be isomorphic with more established governmental social control agencies in order to manage resource uncertainties and assure organizational survival. These findings are relevant to an understanding of linkages between community mediation centers and the state, the struggle for autonomy from the state by mediation practitioners, institutional constraints on community mediation centers generating voluntary users, tensions between staff members' and volunteers' framing of organizational premises and practices, and community mediation's limitations as a vanguard of private alternatives to legal dispute settlement.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3096861,1982,Social Problems,10.2307_3096861

The research addresses three questions: (1) Does a racial gap in income between black and white men persist net of background factors? (2) Are there black-white differences in the amount of income returns to job authority?; and (3) does the black-white gap in income returns to job authority change over time? There is an income gap between black and white men even after controlling for education, experience, hours worked, occupation, authority, region, and city size. There is no difference in the income returns to job authority among men at the lowest levels of authority. However, among men at the highest level of authority, there is a substantial net difference favoring whites over blacks. Finally, there is little evidence that this income gap declined between 1972 and 1994.

1,"The Fractured World of the Temporary Worker: Power, Participation, and Fragmentation in the Contemporary Workplace","Prevailing explanations of power, class fragmentation, participation, and resistance in the contemporary workplace have not explicitly incorporated three factors: the decentered work systems increasingly typical in blue- and white-collar occupations; the terms of the employment contract; and exogenous variables, such as previous labor market experiences, that strengthen or weaken workers' commitments to their jobs. This paper demonstrates the significance of these three factors by investigating the empirical case of temporary workers. Using interview and observational field data, I demonstrate how a system of temporary employment in a participative workplace both exploited and shaped entry-level workers' aspirations and occupational goals. I conclude by suggesting that capacities for collective action, or a social movement that might pose a critique of the current transformation of employment relations into a system increasingly characterized by nonstandard jobs, is limited by structural features and by individual embeddedness in stratified occupational systems.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3097205,1988,Social Problems,10.2307_3097205

1,"Gender, Work-Family Linkages, and Economic Success among Small Business Owners","This study investigates work-family connections and economic success among women and men small business owners. We use what we term gender similarity and gender difference models to frame this investigation. The first model emphasizes the similarities between women and men in the processes through which work outcomes are determined. In contrast, the gender difference model assumes deeply rooted institutional and individual bases of gender difference. Analyses of data from a 3-year panel survey of 99 women and 312 men owners show more support for the gender similarity than the gender difference model. There is considerable gender similarity in the processes through which business and individual characteristics affect personal earnings, although women owners are disadvantaged in some characteristics critical to business success. Family situation has a direct impact on these owners' business success and indirectly affects personal earnings. We uncover vestiges of traditional gender roles consistent with the gender difference model, but primarily in the context of marriage. Thus, children are experienced as an incentive to fulfill the good provider role not only among married men but also by single women.

1,Strategy Matters: The Contingent Value of Social Capital in the Survival of Local Social Movement Organizations,"Social capital plays a central role in facilitating the mobilization of social movement organizations (SMOs). Do the initial mobilization advantages of social capital persist, however, as movement organizations evolve? And do the strategies pursued by social movement organizations affect these advantages? We investigate these questions through a broad empirical analysis of factors affecting the short-term persistence of local chapters of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). Reasoning that multiple forms of social capital would each have a positive impact on survival, we assess the independent effect of several indicators of social capital with mixed results. Consistent with prior research, we find that access to patronage at founding and a greater stock of weak ties in the community confer survival advantages. Yet SMOs that emerged from preexisting groups and those with leaders previously tied to one another through civic engagement were less likely to persist, raising a first cautionary flag about the generality of advantages of resource co-optation and ""bloc recruitment."" The effect of preexisting, strong ties among group leaders varies by how much emphasis the group placed on victim aid activities. Those ties conferred expected survival advantages on groups that did not strongly emphasize victim aid activities. The implications of these results are discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3598342,1995,Social Forces,10.2307_3598342

The study consists of 20 focus groups, each composed of members of one of five kinds of civic organizations. The transcripts are analyzed using bivariate and hierarchical linear modeling techniques. The group context in which political discussions take place is found to have a significant impact on the structure and logic of those discussions, even after accounting for individual-level variations in the demographic characteristics and civic experiences of group participants. A significant portion of civic life and its contribution to democratic citizenship is in social environments that vary in the richness of their political discourse. Elements of political microcultures may explain part of the often-observed differences among civic organizations' degree and type of political mobilization.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3598490,2001,Social Forces,10.2307_3598490

The following article uses this ""tasks and jurisdictions"" approach to describe the evolution of the field of medical practice in the United States during the era of managed care. Large employers and the federal and state governments have created two new and unfamiliar tasks-controlling costs and improving quality for defined populations of patients-and assigned jurisdiction over them to health plans.

1,The Church and Critical Choices in the 1980s,"In the 1960s scholars concerned with the future of the church focused on the new social awareness. By the late 1970s it was the age of limits that dominated their thoughts. Both the future course of society and the impact of the public arena on the religious organization seem even less certain now than they did in the 1960s. This is also true for the ability of organized religion to serve as a value-generating institution in America. One way to approach the future in a structured way is by developing process-oriented scenarios, which let us examine how various courses of development, various choices and events, will interact to produce the social, economic, and religious environment of the next decade or two. Three scenarios are presented - the resource management, frontier spirit, and adversity scenarios - and the trends within each that are particularly relevant to the church are identified. Issues that the church will face in the 1980s are noted.

Following Montgomery (Montgomery, J. D. (1992) American Sociological Review, 57, 586-596), our model is a combination of classical job-search theory and the network hypothesis. First, concerning the monetary consequences, we test our hypotheses empirically by analysing the 2001 International Social Survey Programme on social relations and support systems. We show that using social ties is a common job-search strategy in all countries. However, using social networks does not increase the monetary pay-off. Second, we use a sample of 8,000 Swiss university graduates who recently entered the labour market to show that informal job-search channels are beneficial with respect to important non-monetary job characteristics. Thus, graduates who received their jobs through social contacts tended to get jobs that are linked to their educational degree and offer better career perspectives. Furthermore, using personal networks is related to lower search costs. Therefore, the results suggest overall that networks improve the non-pecuniary characteristics but not the monetary pay-offs.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3806508,1974,European Sociological Review,10.2307_3806508
1,When Does Social Capital Matter? Non-Searching for Jobs across the Life Course,"Non-searchers - people who get their jobs without engaging in a job search - are often excluded from investigations of the role of personal relationships in job finding processes. This practice fails to capture the scope of informal job matching activity and underestimates the effectiveness of social capital. Moreover, studies typically obtain average estimates of social capital effectiveness across broad age ranges, obscuring variation across the life course. Analysis of early career and mid-career job matching shows that non-searching is associated with significant advantages over formal job searching. However, these benefits accrue only during mid-career and primarily among highly experienced male nonsearchers. The results highlight the need to examine life course variations in social capital effectiveness and the role of non-searching as an important informal mechanism in the maintenance of gender inequality.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3844426,2003,Social Forces,10.2307_3844426
1,"Supervisory Bullying, Status Inequalities and Organizational Context","Bullying has been increasingly identified as a significant social problem. Although much of this attention has centered on the context of schooling, researchers are now beginning to recognize that workplaces are also arenas rife with abusive, bullying behaviors. Personality attributes of bullies and victims have received attention, but much less research has examined the social and organizational foundations of bullying. In this article, we focus theoretical attention on the importance of status-based power differentials and organizational context for the emergence of supervisory bullying in employment. Our multimethod analyses, which draw from content-coded organizational ethnographies (N = 204), highlight the importance not only of structural and social vulnerability - such as being in a racial minority or of a low occupational position - but also of chaotic and disorganized workplaces. Poor workplace organization, we show, creates positive motivations for supervisory bullying. Workplaces without capable guardians create further vulnerabilities to bullying as a managerial control tactic. We conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of our results for understanding social power, organizational dynamics and the ramifications of abuse in the workplace.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40345172,2009,Social Forces,10.2307_40345172

We present a case study of the fashion modeling industry. Using participant observation, interviews and network analysis of the Spring/Summer 2007 Fashion Week collections, we explain how producers select models for fashion shows. While fashion producers conceive of their selection of models as a matter of ""taste,"" or personal preference, we find that their decisions are shaped by information sharing mechanisms in social networks, principally through a mechanism known as ""optioning,"" which enables producers to know each others' preferences and to align themselves with similar status actors. For cultural producers, choices are a matter of strategic status considerations, even as they are expressed as a matter of personal taste.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40645820,2009,Social Forces,10.2307_40645820

1,The Development of Czech Environmental Policy 1990-1995: A Sociological Account,"Using the case study of the Czech Republic, the article examines the link between the development of environmental policy and the more general social and economic development of a post-communist society. The initially progressive arrangement of environmental agencies and procedures of the early 1990s, which were in tune with the concurrent development in the West, was abandoned due to the arrested expansion and diversification of the policy community. The ethos of environmental policy-making of the early 1990s, which was a consequence of the special circumstances of that period, could not be maintained in the following years as there was no sufficiently strong social group underpinning and advocating these changes. This is documented on the inability of journalists to grasp and further communicate complex environmental issues, and on the non-existence of a social stratum corresponding to the 'new middle class', from which Western environmental groups draw their support.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41133049,1999,Czech Sociological Review,10.2307_41133049
1,The Labor Market in Czechoslovakia: Changing Attitudes of the Population,"Changes in the labor market are observed on the base of recent surveys from various points of view: 1. the production and utilization of human capital; 2. work incentives and rewards; 3. private ownership and job allocation; 4. work perspectives and unemployment. The transitory period will be very confused. The labor market will be segmented and the development of individual segments will be uneven. Already now, new temporary borderlines are being created. The transformation of the post-communist countries is being carried out in a period when the era of market regulation is over in the West and many securities of the labor market are being eroded. Rather than uniform regulation, the dynamics of individual segments and flexibility in work engagement are needed. The results of our surveys show that the population is not very much troubled and that is aware of the depth of the necessary transformation only to a certain degree.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41133195,1992,Czechoslovak Sociological Review,10.2307_41133195
1,Non-Profit Foundations in Four Countries of Central and Eastern Europe,"The paper presents an analysis of roles and visions of foundations in four Central and Eastern European countries: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Poland. It offers a comparative account of the relevant legislation and the paths taken by these four foundation sectors in the aftermath of the 1989-91 democratic régime changes. They are depicted against a background characterized, among other things, by a partial demise of the state and rapid development of non-profit organizations. Using the methodology and conceptualizations of the research project Roles and visions of foundations in Europe, the authors describe the role profiles of foundations in these countries. They distinguish between role expectations of foundation stakeholders and the roles foundations are actually able to perform, given existing constraints such as legal regulations and limited own resources. The roles are further analyzed as parts of broader social visions in which foundation representatives and other stakeholders in the four CEE countries prefer to locate them. The dominance of certain roles and visions is explained with reference to specific features of post-communist societies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41274965,2006,Polish Sociological Review,10.2307_41274965
1,"On-the-Job Training—A Mechanism for Segregation? Examining the Relationship between Gender, Occupation, and On-the-Job Training Investments","This article aims to examine whether the access to initial on-the-job training differs by gender and to what extent gender differences can be explained by occupational segregation, human capital, and the division of labour in the household. While much research has focussed on formal on-the-job training, I use a measure of initial on-the-job training, or the amount of formal and informal training required to perform a job well. Data come from the Swedish Level of Living Survey 2000 (n = 2,913) and multilevel regression techniques are used. The results show that occupational segregation has a clear mediating effect on the gender difference in initial on-the-job training. The gender gap is reduced by one third when occupation is controlled for and training is related to the number of women in the occupation. Yet, a considerable gap is found also between men and women in the same occupation. This is not explained by human capital investments, nor by female overeducation in relation to the requirements of the job. The gender gap widens in the ages around 30, but factors such as motherhood, work interruptions, and housework are not related to on-the-job training, and part-time work explains very little of the gender gap.",external-fulltext-any,2012,European Sociological Review,10.2307_41495132

I conducted participant observation and interviews in a multi-ethnic, workingclass organization which combines two community organizing models: a relational model and an institutionally-focused model. Members of the organization collectively critiqued dominant ideologies and public policies about welfare and engaged in dialogue with political authorities about economic issues. In these processes, experiences of collective identity formation and personal identity transformation increased members' political motivation and sense of empowerment relative to the welfare system and other dominant institutions. I argue that the implications of identity formation and transformation are important in evaluating the success of community organizing efforts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41675005,2002,"Race, Gender & Class",10.2307_41675005

By the 1920s, however, the structural shifts within the larger political economy were challenging the nature of the Jewish working-class community as a racialized counterpublic. While the male leadership of the ILGWU embraced these changes and advocated for a centralized, expert-led model of communication within the union, Jewish women took a more progressive approach and fought for a model of labor education that facilitated the maintenance of a democratic, ethnic counterpublic in the face of mass culture. The ultimate triumph of the male leadership within the union culminated in the commercialization of its largest effort in mass education—radio station WEVD. It also signaled the transformation of a local, ethnic working-class culture into part of White, consumer society.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41675365,2008,"Race, Gender & Class",10.2307_41675365

Using data on 53 diseases over 19 years, I find that in addition to securing direct benefits, advocacy organizations have aggregate effects and can systemically change the culture of policy arenas.

Membership in a FILM might be expected to enhance one's OC for several reasons: FILMs are assumed to be associated with greater promotion opportunities, earnings, firm-specific skills, and autonomy; and less likely to be related to unionization. We measure these concepts and examine their role in linking FILMs and OC. Our analysis is based on two nationally representative samples of employees and work organizations in Norway and the United States. We find that FILMs are only weakly related or unrelated to OC in both Norway and the United States.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4200907,1975,Acta Sociologica,10.2307_4200907
1,"System's Sole Constituent, the Operation: Clarifying a Central Concept of Luhmannian Theory","The autopoietic turn in Luhmann's later theory is not thinkable without the refocusing of systems theory around a new concept of operativity. The article shows the lines of development from the earlier theory towards the final prevailing of a purely operativist conception of the system. The movement is one of deconstructing all intuitive representations of a border-defined, thing-like system. The radical version that emerges leaves the operation as the sole and unique systemic constituent. The article shows that such a strain of thought contracting an extensive transitive structure into a purely operative core has major philosophical antecedents: Aristotle's conception of the actuation of life or intellection in a composite being, Fichte's self-position of the transcendental I, Heidegger's subject and authorless 'Ereignis' constitute very similar figures of 'operativization'. This sheds light on the most problematic aspect of Luhmannian theory, namely its reliance on a 'protologic' that does not elaborate, like similar philosophical endeavours before it, on the fundaments of its own evidence.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4201182,1989,Acta Sociologica,10.2307_4201182
1,"Globalization, Governance, and the Diffusion of the American Model of Education: Accreditation Agencies and American-Style Universities in the Middle East","This article is principally concerned with the transnational and domestic governance regimes that oversee American-style universities in the Persian Gulf region. In the current context of globalization, social scientists have examined the mechanisms by which organizational practices are transferred when transnational corporations establish subsidiaries in other countries or when international nongovernmental organizations collaborate with partners in the developing world to create externally developed prescriptions translated into locally viable action. Comparatively little work, however, has been done on the challenges of exporting, from one cultural and political context to another, an institution of higher education or a particular model for how higher education should be practiced. Although a variety of actors feature in the process of conveying organizational practices and cultural scripts, this article focuses primarily on the role of accreditation agencies and the practice of accreditation. In theorizing the relationship between the following four actors, i.e., external accrediting agencies, locally based quality assurance organizations, ministries of higher education, and Western universities located in the Gulf, Noori argues that the New Medievalism provides an analytically useful explanatory framework for understanding issues of governance with respect to American-style universities in the Gulf region.",external-fulltext-any,2013,"International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society",10.2307_42636450

Based on empirical examples drawn from the nuclear energy debates in Germany and the United States, an attempt is made to develop a political process perspective that links structure and action in a four-component account.

In addition, differences in the ways that careers unfold in ILMs and non-ILMs appear to be partially responsible for age variation in employee commitment within non-ILMs.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42863586,1990,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42863586
1,"Debt, Mergers and Acquisitions, Institutional Arrangements and Change to the Multilayered Subsidiary Form","Objective. Despite the rapid increase in corporate debt and prevalence of mergers and acquisitions, researchers have not examined whether these changes have affected corporate form change. The purpose of this research is to examine causes of change from the multidivisional (MDF) to the multilayered subsidiary form (MLSF). The MLSF is a corporation with a hierarchy of two or more levels of subsidiary corporations with a parent company at the top of the hierarchy operating as a management company. Methods. Using logistic regression analysis, we examine causes of change to the MLSF in the largest 100 U.S. industrial corporations. Results. Although corporations organized some of their assets as subsidiaries throughout the twentieth century, corporations began to organize more of their assets as subsidiaries in response to capital accumulation constraints (e.g., rising debt, increasing competition) in the early 1980s. Continued economic constraints resulted in corporate political behavior in the mid-1980s that produced changes in state business policy. These policy changes provided a political-legal structure for tax-free corporate restructuring of divisions as subsidiary corporations. Change in state business policy also provided a means for corporations to merge, acquire, and spin off subsidiary corporations tax-free. The results show that corporations' with more mergers and acquisitions, more long-term debt, liabilityprone product lines, and declining dividends are significantly more likely to change from the MDF to the MLSF. Conclusions. The analysis supports capital dependence theory. The MLSF creates internal capital markets, reduces corporations'",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42863877,1999,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42863877
1,The Impact of Structural Reform on County Government Service Provision,"Objective. This study examines the effect that county government structure has on county spending in an environment of rapid population growth. In particular, it looks at the consequence of changing from a traditional commission noncharter form to an appointed administrator/elected executive commission type with a home rule charter. Methods. This study uses a pooled time-series design to analyze the spending behavior of seven rapid-growth counties in Florida that adopted a modernized structure between 1980 and 1990. Results. The findings indicate that changing the form of county government leads to a statistically significant increase in total spending as well as for spending for traditional and regional services. Conclusions. In addition to the theoretical implications for studying government structural impacts, there are practical implications for county officials in rapidly growing areas who view the adoption of modernized structures as a means to facilitate the expansion of current services and/or the addition of new services.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42955908,2003,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42955908

The method is content analysis of media coverage and congressional legislative activity following the 1999 Columbine High School shootings. Results. The results show that while both agendas converged on the gun-control aspect of the problem, they substantially diverged on other understandings of what kind of problem the Columbine shooting represented and how to address it.

This article addresses the extent to which race differences in employment entry, exits, or both are responsible for the gap. Methods. The article relies on event-history analysis using NLSY data. Results. Analyses show that differences in rates of exit, not entry, explain the race gap. Factors encouraging higher exit rates among African-American than white women include lower AFQT scores and greater numbers of children. Conclusion. These findings raise questions about the utility of focusing on employment processes at the point of employment entry, at least for processes involving young women.

1,Examining the Administration of Work Sanctions on the Frontlines of the Welfare System,"Objectives. Financial penalties, or sanctions, are a core mechanism for enforcing the work requirements of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and helping clients achieve self-sufficiency. This study's objective is to examine whether sanctions are being administered consistent with policy goals of encouraging work. Methods. This study uses administrative fair hearing decisions, which are the product of an adversarial-style procedure triggered when a client appeals an adverse decision by the agency, including work sanctions. Qualitative content analysis is used to analyze the decisions. Results. The study found that despite organizational reforms, local offices had created the welfare-to-work version of an eligibility-compliance culture, where sanctions were based primarily on attendance records and became a paper-processing function. Transactions between clients and workers were often routinized and mechanical, resulting in improper and arbitrary sanctions that were reversed by the hearing officers nearly 50 percent of the time. Conclusion. This study underscores the importance of scrutinizing and correcting agency errors that may undercut clients' engagement in work activities.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42956142,2006,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42956142
1,"Resisting Charters: A Comparative Policy Development Analysis of Washington and Kentucky, 2002-2012","Over the past two decades, most states have adopted laws enabling charter schools, as charter advocates successfully presented charters as the solution to core problems in urban public education. Yet some states with large urban centers, notably Washington and Kentucky, resisted this seemingly inexorable trend for years. What explains their resistance? Furthermore, why did Washington—a state with a strong teachers' union and long-standing Democratic political control (resources for charter resistance identified in prior research)—ultimately adopt charters in 2012 while Kentucky has not? I use comparative-historical narrative analysis to trace differences in charter battles in the urban centers of the two states. I find that supporters framed charters as the solution in both cases but varied in their ability to name public schools as the problem in the first place. I identify the source of the discursive resources used by opponents of charter schools in state-level ""educational ecosystems"": the cultural and institutional legacies of a range of state educational policies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43186815,2014,Sociology of Education,10.2307_43186815

For example, compliance with two rules for securing electronic health information in the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act took longer than expected and was highly uneven across U.S. hospitals. We analyzed 3,321 medium and large hospitals using data from the 2003 Health Information and Management Systems Society Analytics Database. We find that organizational strategies and institutional environments influence hospital compliance, and further that institutional logics moderate the effect of some strategies, indicating the interplay of regulation, institutions, and organizations that contribute to the extensive variation that characterizes the U.S. health care system. Understanding whether and how health care organizations like hospitals respond to new regulation has important implications both for creating desired health care reform and for medical sociologists interested in the changing organizational structure of health care.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43186884,2014,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_43186884
1,"The Worldwide Expansion of ""Organization""","We offer an institutional explanation for the contemporary expansion of formal organization—in numbers, internal complexity, social domains, and national contexts. Much expansion lies in areas far beyond the traditional foci on technical production or political power, such as protecting the environment, promoting marginalized groups, or behaving with transparency. We argue that expansion is supported by widespread cultural rationalization in a stateless and liberal global society, characterized by scientism, rights and empowerment discourses, and an explosion of education. These cultural changes are transmitted through legal, accounting, and professionalization principles, driving the creation of new organizations and the elaboration of existing ones. The resulting organizations are constructed to be proper social actors as much as functionally effective entities. They are painted as autonomous and integrated but depend heavily on external definitions to sustain this depiction. So expansion creates organizations that are, whatever their actual effectiveness, structurally nonrational. We advance institutional theories of social organization in three main ways. First, we give an account of the expansive rise of ""organization"" rooted in rapid worldwide cultural rationalization. Second, we explain the construction of contemporary organizations as purposive actors, rather than passive bureaucracies. Third, we show how the expanded actorhood of the contemporary organization, and the associated interpnetration with the environment, dialectically generate structures far removed from instrumental rationality.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43187345,2013,Sociological Theory,10.2307_43187345
1,Dilettante or Renaissance Person? How the Order of Job Experiences Affects Hiring in an External Labor Market,"Social actors who move across categories are typically disadvantaged relative to their more focused peers. Yet candidates who compile experiences across disparate areas can either be appreciated as renaissance individuals or penalized as dilettantes. Extant literature has focused on the comparison between single versus multiple category members and on skill assessment, hindering its applicability. To discriminate between more versus less successful category spanners, I suggest that the order of accumulated experiences matters, because it serves as an indicator of commitment. I propose the concept of erraticism and predict that employers will prefer candidates who demonstrate some erraticism, by moving incrementally between similar jobs, over candidates who do not move and also over those with highly erratic job histories. Furthermore, I suggest this relationship holds for more complex jobs, less experienced freelancers, and is attenuated through working together. These issues are particularly salient given the rise of external labor markets where careers are increasingly marked by moves across traditional boundaries. I test and find support for these hypotheses with data from an online crowd-sourced labor market for freelancing services, Elance. com. I discuss how virtual mediated labor markets may alter hiring processes.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43187529,2014,American Sociological Review,10.2307_43187529
1,Who's the Boss? Explaining Gender Inequality in Entrepreneurial Teams,"Sociologists have examined gender inequalities across a wide array of social contexts. Yet, questions remain regarding how inequalities arise among autonomous groups pursuing economic goals. In this article, we investigate mixed-sex entrepreneurial teams to unpack the mechanisms by which gender inequality in leadership emerges, despite strong pressures toward merit-based organizing principles. We theorize the potentially competing relationships between merit and gender and explore the contingencies moderating their effects. Drawing on a unique, nationally representative dataset of entrepreneurial teams sampled from the U.S. population in 2005, we use conditional logistic regression to test our hypotheses. We demonstrate that merit's effect becomes much larger when multiple merit-based criteria provide consistent predictions for which team member is superior to others, and when entrepreneurial founders adopt bureaucratic templates to construct new ventures. However, gender stereotypes of leaders pervasively constrain women's access to power positions, and gender's effect intensifies when spousal relationships are involved. Women have reduced chances to be in charge if they co-found new businesses with their husbands, and some family conditions further modify women's chances, such as husbands' employment and the presence of children.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43187538,2014,American Sociological Review,10.2307_43187538

1,Establishing A Consulting/Research Firm: The Nitty Gritty,"This article identifies the critical elements that are involved in developing a consulting and research organization. In developing such a firm, there are certain minimum requirements that obviously must be met from the outset: for instance, the acquisition of an office as well as certain types of hardware and office equipment is a necessity. In addition, developing such an organization means hiring professional and administrative staff who will support the work. A second aspect which is of critical importance -- and also a pre-requisite to obtaining work -- is establishing credibility. This assures prospective clients that the service which the organization provides is of the highest professional quality. Learning how to deal with clients, however, is a key to obtaining work — the third element of critical importance. Indeed, when writing proposals in response to RFP's issued by government agencies, there are specific guidelines that, if followed, may increase the chances of getting a particular job -- whether this job is at the federal, state, or local level. Finally, the success of the organization will ultimately depend on the marketing strategy that is used to promote the organization. In the following pages the importance of all of these topics -- the minimum requirements, establishing credibility/dealing with clients, obtaining work, and marketing -- are discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43481264,1984,Journal of Applied Sociology,10.2307_43481264
1,European Shiism? Counterpoints from Shiites' organization in Britain and the Netherlands,"European Shiism is a neglected area in studies of European Islam, which raises the question of to what extent Shiism in Europe represents a particular realm of organization and a particular religiosity. Shiism's striking transnational features, and general findings on European Islam, suggest prolific border-crossing and cross-ethnic organization among Shiites in Europe. Exploring British and Dutch cases, however, leaves little room for the notion of a specific European Shiite realm. When focusing on the ethnicnational background of board members of Shiite organizations and on their formal organizational interlocks, ethnically articulate identities come to the fore, particular mixes of which take shape within sub-European frameworks of states. The last section explores sociopolitical implications of Shiites' organizational life in Europe, as seen through the Dutch and British samples. A contrast is drawn between the relative scarcity of Shiite organization, which delimits the role of Shiism as a political actor in Europe, and recent indications of civic engagement.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43572622,2012,Ethnicities,10.2307_43572622

In addition to the organizations' specialized fields, interventions by external actors such as the United Nations and the International Criminal Court affect NGO framing, but they do so in organization-specific ways.

The threat / opportunity lens encompasses two conceptually distinct dimensions, gain / loss and control / limited control, which are hypothesized to produce different patterns of network interaction. Two experimental studies—one involving 158 leaders in a health-care organization and the other involving 129 employees in a range of smaller establishments—provided support for the proposed conceptualization. The studies found that (1) people chose to interact with more network contacts in situations of loss than in situations of gain, (2) those with an internal locus of control chose to interact with more network contacts in situations of limited control than in situations of control, whereas those with an external locus of control exhibited the opposite response, and (3) the tendency to interact with more network contacts in loss rather than gain was greater for low-ranking actors relative to high-ranking ones. These findings contribute to our understanding of the interplay between individual cognition and organizational social networks.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/44076830,2015,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_44076830

1,"From Wage Slaves to Wage Workers: Cultural Opportunity Structures and the Evolution of the Wage Demands of the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor, 1880-1900","This paper examines the reasons behind a historic shift in the language couching the wage demands of two North American labor movements during the last twenty years of the 19th century - the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor. We trace how the once dominant imagery of ""wage slavery"" lost its connection to producerist labor ideology and eventually was replaced by the more pragmatic symbolism of ""wage work."" This linguistic shift is of particular scholarly importance because it occurred during a time when producerist labor politics, with its emphasis on a radical reorganization of work and private property, lost significant ground to a more consumerist/economistic version of labor politics. We show that this pivotal rhetorical shift was linked to changes in the cultural opportunity structure. These were, in turn, shaped through movement sector dynamics and through changes in the empirical referents which add meaning and resonance to social movement claims.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4494978,1993,Social Forces,10.2307_4494978
1,"Organizational Diversity, Vitality and Outcomes in the Civil Rights Movement","Sociologists often assert, but rarely test, the claim that organizational diversity benefits social movements by invigorating movement vitality and facilitating success. Our analysis of black civil rights organizations shows that goal and tactical diversity of a social movement is largely a function of organizational density, level of resources available to the movement, and the number of protests initiated by the movement. Goal diversity increases the rate of protest, whereas tactical diversity increases the likelihood of achieving a desired policy outcome. These findings advance our understanding of social movements and organizations by illuminating how organizational dynamics of a social movement might change over time, and in turn how this change might affect the vitality and desired outcomes of social movements.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4494999,2004,Social Forces,10.2307_4494999

1,"The Population and Community Ecology of Organizational Founding: Italian Co-Operative Banks, 1936-1989","Ecological models of organizational founding are proposed in order to investigate the effect of competitive and institutional processes on the founding rates in two populations of co-operative banks in Italy for the period 1936-1989. A number of stochastic specifications of organizational founding rates are estimated to test the effects of density dependence, resource partitioning and community interdependence on the vital dynamics of the organizational populations under study. Processes of density dependence and resource partitioning are shown to have a different impact on the founding rate of generalist and specialist organizations. The empirical analysis reveals the existence of community-level patterns of asymmetric mutualism between the two populations of banking organizations. While the proliferation of Rural Co-operative banks accelerated the founding rate of Popular Co-operative banks, the founding rate of Rural Co-operative banks was unaffected by the number of Popular Co-operative banks in existence. The results generally support the view that institutional constraints encoded in organizational forms shape the vital dynamics of organizational populations over long time periods.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/522847,1990,European Sociological Review,10.2307_522847

As a newly constructed practice of design was threatened by broad changes affecting the structure of occupational control, explicit professionalizing projects emerged from the ideological organization of professional work itself. This paper identifies limitations of the market monopoly model and outlines an alternative view that focuses on the way the rhetorical dimensions of professional work organize the efforts of actors within a self-reproducing structure of occupational control. Analysis of the production of practical knowledge opens up new directions for research, incorporating the cultural dimensions of work into a macrostructural account of a profession and the processes of professionalization.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/684324,1977,Sociological Forum,10.2307_684324
1,The Organizational Shaping of Collective Identity: The Case of Lesbian and Gay Film Festivals in New York,"Using information gathered during fieldwork on New York lesbian and gay film festival organizations, this paper argues that scholarship on identity has not paid sufficient attention to the organizational mediation of collective identity. The shape of collective identity--how internal instabilities and diversities are accommodated, in this case--depends not only on the emergent characteristics of the ""collective,"" but also on the resolution of challenges particular to organizational fields. Two very differently conceived lesbian and gay festival organizations, sites at which decision making about collective identity is ongoing and self-conscious, are examined. The analysis traces how each responds to two related tasks: maintaining community legitimacy, which requires racial diversification, and surviving within an altered institutional environment. Rather than imposition from ""above"" or construction from ""below,"" the adaptive responses by organizations (to changes in both community expectations and the resource environment) transform the collective identity formulations reaching public visibility.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/684839,1985,Sociological Forum,10.2307_684839

Specifically, growing segments of female, black and Hispanic, and lower and middle class doctors are focused upon in the analysis. Several important structural forces related to managed care and the nature of medical work are discussed and examined as well. The results suggests that it is useful to consider factors internal to professions in explaining large-scale professional change. This does not mean forgetting about the role played by structure in this change. Instead, it supports incorporating stratification perspectives into studies of professionals and of considering micro levels of analysis which acknowledge and investigate the effects of intraprofessional diversity.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/684928,1994,Sociological Forum,10.2307_684928

This paper examines the history of claimsmaking activity involving Asian American organizations, university officials, state and federal institutions, and neoconservatives within the context of a shifting discourse on admissions. My discussion of the construction and viability of claims shows how participants use facts as important resources in claimsmaking activity. But while facts often seem to be at the very center of the Asian admissions controversy, I argue that their importance and meaning depends fully upon the particular contexts in which they are created and used. At the same time, although participants contest the meaning of facts, they never seem to deny their importance as measures of a reality distinct from the controversy and fact production process.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/800583,1988,Social Problems,10.2307_800583
1,Symbolic Interaction and Applied Social Research: A Focus on Translational Science,"In symbolic interaction, a traditional yet unfortunate and unnecessary distinction has been made between basic and applied research. The argument has been made that basic research is intended to generate new knowledge, whereas applied research is intended to apply knowledge to the solution of practical (social and organizational) problems. I will argue that the distinction between basic and applied research in symbolic interaction is outdated and dysfunctional. The masters of symbolic interactionist thought have left us a proud legacy of shaping their scholarly thinking and inquiry in response to and in light of practical issues of the day (e.g., Park and Blumer). Current interactionist work continues this tradition in topical areas such as social justice studies. Applied research, especially in term of evaluation and needs assessment studies, can be designed to serve both basic and applied goals. Symbolic interaction provides three great resources to do this. The first is its orientation to dynamic sensitizing concepts that direct research and ask questions instead of supplying a priori and often impractical answers. The second is its orientation to qualitative methods, and appreciation for the logic of grounded theory. The third is interactionism's overall holistic approach to interfacing with the everyday life world. The primary illustrative case here is the qualitative component of the evaluation of an National Institutes of Health-funded, translational medical research program. The qualitative component has provided interactionist-inspired insights into translational research, such as examining cultural change in medical research in terms of changes in the form and content of formal and informal discourse among scientists; delineating the impact of significant symbols such as “my lab” on the social organization of science; and appreciating the essence of the self-concept “scientist” on the increasingly bureaucratic and administrative identities of medical researchers. This component has also contributed to the basic social scientific literature on complex organizations and the self.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/symbinte.37.3.412,2014,Symbolic Interaction,10.2307_symbinte.37.3.412

They find that: (1) there was initially a consensus among actors on the scientific utility of evaluation research; (2) this consensus has broken down as actors realize the various economic, political and value implications of evaluation research for their own interests, and as they struggle to control the process. Because of this interaction of interests and perceptions of function, the authors predict that evaluation research will be, increasingly, the activity of the ""for profit"" research organizations, rather than of university based social scientists.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20831098,1978,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20831098

Using data from the 1985 General Social Survey, I find that these gender differences arise in part from dissimilar social structural locations of men and women, which lead to distinct opportunities for and constraints on the formation of close personal ties. Most gender differences in network composition disappear or are considerably reduced when variables related to employment, family, and age are controlled. However, some gender differences remain. Women have a larger number, higher proportion, and greater diversity of kin ties in their personal networks than men, even when compared with men in similar social structural positions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095868,1985,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2095868

Returns to years of schooling tend to be greater for whites, but returns to curriculum and vocational training are generally greater for blacks. The major exceptions to stronger effects of vocational training for blacks involve skilled manual training and occupations dealing with things. The findings are interpreted as indicating that (a) the usual status attainment model has inadequately specified the relationship between educational and occupational attainment, (b) the common conclusion that black occupational outcomes are less predictable than those of whites is unwarranted, and (c) curriculum and vocational training have such strong effects for blacks because they help move blacks into people- and data-processing occupations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2578072,1979,Social Forces,10.2307_2578072
0.5,Normative versus Social Constructivist Processes in the Allocation of Citations: A Network-Analytic Model,"I assess competing arguments on the determinants of scientists' citation patterns by developing a new approach to the multivariate study of citations that builds upon a network-analytic model. Using data on articles about celestial masers, an astrophysics research area, logistic regressions with robust standard errors examine the extent to which characteristics of both potentially citing and potentially cited papers influence the probability that a citation exists between the papers. The results identify significant positive effects of cited article cognitive content and cited article quality, providing support for a normative interpretation of the allocation of citations in which citations reflect payment of intellectual debt. In contrast, indicators of an author's position within the stratification structure of science fail to significantly improve the fit of the model, and thus provide no support for the social constructivist claim that citations are rhetorical tools of persuasion. Furthermore, the lack of effects of social ties between citing and cited authors provides little support for the argument that authors who know one another are more likely to cite one another's work. Overall, these results suggest that authors are likely to cite those articles most relevant to their work in terms of intellectual content, and seem little concerned with the characteristics of authors who write them.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657504,1984,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657504

Structural equation modeling was used with survey data from 6,670 adolescents, ages 12 to 17. In the first model, statistically significant coefficients were associated with paths from mistrust of companies to mistrust of the tobacco industry, from mistrust of the tobacco industry to anti-tobacco industry attitudes, and from anti-tobacco industry attitudes to smoking. In models stratified by mistrust of companies, paths from mistrust of the tobacco industry to anti-tobacco industry attitudes and from anti-tobacco industry attitudes to smoking appeared comparable among youth with both high and low mistrust of companies. These results suggest that anti-tobacco industry campaigns resonate with youth because of youths' trust-related values and expectations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/30040330,2006,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_30040330

Analysis of longitudinal data on two social movement groups in Pittsburgh from 2003 to 2007 shows that social movements variously interpret the nature and role of their audiences and that these interpretations affect their strategies and goals, sometimes quite radically.

The following variables were correlated with the career success of both sexes: broad scope of professional activity, academic degree beyond the lowest one, contact with male co-workers outside working hours, & freedom from homemaking obligations. Among women also good performance in secondary school, faithful service to the same employer, urban location, & progressive attitude toward woman's role in working life were correlated significantly with success. Among men only good academic performance, high prestige of father's profession, job changes, working overtime, keeping up with professional literature, & a non-employed wife were characteristic of those successful in their careers.

The central question concerns whether the racial makeup of a community near a chemical-processing site is characteristic of the city, county, or community as a whole. In essence, does the racial makeup of a community vary by distance from a chemical-processing facility? Methods. A comparison of the racial makeup of the community was examined for 13 chemical-processing sites submitting off-site consequence data under the Environmental Protection Agency Risk Management Plan, by clusters of the sites, and for all sites in the community. Instead of relative ratios, we look at odds ratios. The odds ratio compares the odds of being African American to the odds of being non-African American at two given distance classes. In this way we may make inferences about how much higher (or lower) are the odds of an African American (relative to a non-African American) living in a closer distance class (as opposed to a further distance class). Results. The results show that as one moves further from a facility, the characteristics of the community reflect less and less the makeup near the site. The percentage of African Americans living near a chemical-processing site tends to be much higher when compared to population characteristics further from the site. Conclusions. The study shows that distance does make a significant difference in the racial characteristics of the population from a chemical-processing site. Using data reflecting accidental-release scenarios, weather conditions, and the chemical process from the local community provides a more realistic basis for determining vulnerability zones.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42956288,2002,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42956288

0,Emotion and Group Cohesion in Productive Exchange,"This study refines and experimentally tests a theory of relational cohesion that explains how and when actors become committed to one another in the context of multiactor exchange. The theory asserts that frequent social exchange results in (1) positive emotions that solidify and strengthen the person‐to‐group bond and (2) uncertainty reduction that renders the focal group more salient in relation to others. These two mechanisms produce a sense of psychological group formation and ultimately increase observable acts of commitment. In a “productive exchange” setting, three actors negotiate a joint venture that requires the assent of all members. The exchanges featured two forms of commitment behavior: the giving of small token gifts and the decision to invest in a three‐way prisoner’s dilemma. The results suggest that positive emotion and uncertainty reduction are theoretically distinct and affect commitment behavior through different mechanisms. The article concludes by discussing the general implications for commitment and social order.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/318965,2000,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_318965

Two theoretical claims link the production of tightness and consensus to formal properties of social structure. Cognitive authority is hypothesized to produce tightness, as beliefs that are in the same domain of authoritative judgment may be connected via webs of implications. The clarity of the power structure is hypothesized to produce consensus, as an inability to conceive of alternatives to the domestic order translates into an inability to conceive of alternatives in beliefs.

Using four national case studies, this article shows that economic and financial globalization played a critical role in fostering the transition to neoliberal policies, but that local institutional conditions were decisive in shaping the nature and meaning of the shift. While the analysis finds that developing countries appear more dependent upon direct external pressures than developed ones, it also shows that institutionalized patterns of state‐society relations determined the way in which neoliberal transitions were carried out, somewhat irrespectively of the level of economic development. In Chile and Britain, poorly mediated distributional conflict created the ideological conditions for a “monetarist” revolution. In Mexico and France, on the other hand, neoliberalism was understood mainly as a necessary step to adapt the country to the international economy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/367922,2002,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_367922

This article uses the case of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising to show that collective action need not always require opportunity. Warsaw Jews’ armed resistance was a response not to opportunity but to a lack thereof. Equally important was a strong sense of honor among the ghetto fighters: the hopelessness of their situation helped construct a motivational frame that equated resistance with honor and made collective resistance possible. This case therefore illustrates how framing processes can mediate structural conditions to produce collective action in the absence of opportunity. It also points to the need for additional research on protest and resistance in nondemocratic settings.,https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/379528,2003,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_379528

This study places these arguments in a larger demographic context by providing a national analysis of neighborhood inequality and spatial inequality of different racial and ethnic groups in urban America. The findings show that there has been no change over time in the degree to which majority-black neighborhoods are surrounded by spatial disadvantage. Predominantly black neighborhoods, regardless of socioeconomic composition, continue to be spatially linked with areas of severe disadvantage. However, there has been substantial change in the degree to which middle- and upper-income African-American households have separated themselves from highly disadvantaged neighborhoods. These changes are driven primarily by the growing segment of middle- and upper-income African-Americans living in neighborhoods in which they are not the majority group, both in central cities and in suburbs.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/674561,2014,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_674561

0,Decolonizing Sexual Violence,This study explores how professional Indigenous women respond to the presentation of survey data on sexual assault in a conference setting. Sexual assault survey data presented within the context of colonization can provide a platform for Indigenous women to speak out. This study centers the voices of Indigenous women as central for understanding issues of prevalence. Indigenous women are situated in difficult intersections because solidarity to stand united against ongoing colonial influences with fellow community members and engage decolonization efforts often come at a high cost of keeping silent about their victimization. Understanding the unique position Indigenous women occupy is critical to understanding the dynamics surrounding speaking out and seeking justice for survivors after sexual assault.,https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/irqr.2013.6.4.526,2013,International Review of Qualitative Research,10.1525_irqr.2013.6.4.526

0,Embodied Fluidity and the Commitment to Movement: Constructing the Moral Self through Arthritis Narratives,"While biomedical research reifies bodily movement in the lives of people with chronic illness as “functional mobility,” our analysis of biographical osteoarthritis narratives uncovers a moral commitment to movement as both a moral imperative and a technique to preserve a self threatened by the limits arthritis places on daily life. A content analysis of twelve interviews with arthritis sufferers shows that, in addition to the practical and emotional challenges of living with arthritis, these actors face the daily challenge of displaying their understanding of embodied fluidity—the timely and fluid movement through time and space—as a virtuous practice. Our informants use the movement mandate—the commitment to move despite the pain it may cause—to produce themselves as competent social and moral actors sacrificing the demands of their bodies to meet social expectations, and they conduct this performance in front of several audiences: the self and specific and generalized others. For these informants, in both private and public realms, the experience and the management of pain and physical limitation are profoundly social and accountable matters, as they affect interactions with others, their own social identities and moral integrity, and their relations with self as they seek to balance their arthritis pain with their past, present, and future self-concepts.

Applying Scott and Lyman's (1968) framework on accounts and Markus and Nurius's (1986) framework of possible selves to interview data with twenty-eight criminal offenders, I illustrate how excuses for past behavior provide a way for people to distance themselves from their past selves in attempts to preserve or re-create a possible self that is still worthy to be redeemed in the future. This discourse becomes one mechanism that motivates individuals to change their lives—but it can be short-lived. The analysis highlights how limited structural opportunities influence individuals' lifestyles and behaviors, how individuals approach the desistance process even in the face of structural deprivation, and how they attempt to sustain this desistance process.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/si.2011.34.1.63,2011,Symbolic Interaction,10.1525_si.2011.34.1.63

0,Residential Patterns Across Generations of New Immigrant Groups,"This article explores residential patterns across generations of new immigrant groups. The discussion is situated in a multi-ethnic context. The analysis is based on data from the 2001 Canadian census and focuses on three visible minority groups in the four largest metropolitan areas of Canada. In line with the spatial assimilation perspective, the authors found that visible minority groups reside in neighborhoods where, over generations, as the proportion of whites increases, the proportions of their own group and other minority groups decline. The findings also show support that socioeconomic resources are positively related to residential integration and that each successive generation is more efficient than the previous generation in translating socioeconomic resources. However, echoing the place stratification perspective, variations in the effect of socioeconomic resources within each group and generation have been documented. Taken together, the results suggest that the factors contributing to residential integration are more complicated in a multi-ethnic context.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sop.2009.52.3.409,2009,Sociological Perspectives,10.1525_sop.2009.52.3.409

0,Modularity and Transferability of Repertoires of Contention,"A “modular repertoire of contention” denotes prevalent forms of interaction that are used by a variety of actors against a variety of targets for a variety of issues in a variety of locations. Modular repertoires are important in the literature of contentious politics and social movements because of their transferability across different contentious contexts. This study addresses three limitations in the literature. First, discussion about modular repertoires to date has been framed as if some forms of contention were modular and other forms were not—thus a dichotomy is set up between modular and nonmodular forms. Second, specific dimensions of modularity (transferability across actors, targets, issues, and locations) have been mostly ignored in the literature. Third, an empirical measure has not yet been developed for the concept. By assessing how broadly a form of contention is diffused across actors, targets, issues, and locations, this study develops a new measure of modularity. Using the measure, it evaluates Charles Tilly's modular repertoire hypothesis. According to the hypothesis, public meetings, petitions, and demonstrations became a modular repertoire in Great Britain during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as a result of Parliament's rise as the center of British national politics. The results obtained here offer new insights. The empirical measure proposed will advance our understanding of repertoires of contention and political systems.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sp.2012.59.4.544,2012,Social Problems,10.1525_sp.2012.59.4.544

Drawing upon Schutz's phenomenology of social relations, we amplify theoretically the Durkheimian perspective and suggest that the universalization process is stimulated by an increase in anonymity (as opposed to intimacy) in society. Structural factors consistent with anonymity -- i.e., increasing population density, political and economic differentiation, and monetary exchange -- are hypothesized to influence the universalization of ritual occasions. A recursive path model is devised for the hypothesized relationships in the universalization process. We find support for the model using data from a cross-cultural sample of nonindustrial societies. The implications of these results for understanding religious rituals in contemporary complex societies are then discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1387003,1981,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1387003

Major theoretical, methodological, and empirical contributions to the study of household labor are summarized, and suggestions for further research are offered. In summary, women have reduced and men have increased slightly their hourly contributions to housework. Although men's relative contributions have increased, women still do at least twice as much routine housework as men. Consistent predictors of sharing include both women's and men's employment, earnings, gender ideology, and life-course issues. More balanced divisions of housework are associated with women perceiving fairness, experiencing less depression, and enjoying higher marital satisfaction.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1566732,1993,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_1566732

0,When Scientists Meet Film-Makers: Inventing a Swedish Approach to Public Engagement with Biotechnology,"The new interest in staging public engagements with science, and the biosciences in particular, has been widely associated with a 'democratic turn' in the public understanding of science movement. This article seeks to bring this association under closer scrutiny by focusing on the development of public engagement with biotechnology in Sweden. It analyses the production and dramatic composition of a two-part film documentary entitled ""Life at Stake"", financed by the Swedish research community and broadcast on public service television. Particular attention is paid to the actions of the new non-profit organization Scientists Meet Film-Makers, and the crucial mediating role this organization played in creating the conditions of possibility for ""Life at Stake"" to be financed, produced and broadcast. In conclusion, rather than supporting a new logic of deliberation, ""Life at Stake"" is discussed as more concerned with symbolization and spectacle in its use of images of suffering and hope as the touchstone of truth about biotechnology in society. In this way, science communicators appear to be displaying a willingness to learn from the media practices of environmental organizations and other protest groups, who have long appreciated the importance of contesting symbolic codes and schemes of meaning in society.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20059946,2005,Acta Sociologica,10.2307_20059946

Until recently, this problem was difficult to study under controlled conditions due to the inability to conduct experiments involving interaction between participants located in physically distant locations. We report results of an experiment using a Web-based ""virtual lab"" to study trust and trustworthiness between Japanese and Americans in real-time interaction. Participants played a variation of the Trust Game in two different experimental conditions: a ""flags-on"" condition in which everyone's nationality was publicly identified during the session, and a ""flags-off"" condition in which participants did not know who was Japanese or American. The findings most strongly support Yamagishi's structural theory of trust, which predicts that Japanese will form more durable exchange relations compared to Americans. We found less support for explanations that focus on cultural differences in trust and trustworthiness, and for cognitive explanations that point to the effects of a shared social identity between participants and partners with common nationality.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20141807,2007,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_20141807
0,Pictures of Nothing? Visual Construals in Social Theory,"This paper builds upon ethnomethodological and social constructivist studies of representation in the natural sciences to examine sociological theory, a field that is much closer to home. An analysis of diagrams and related illustrations in theory texts shows that labels, geometric boundaries, vectors, and symmetries often are used to convey a sense of orderly flows of causal influences in a homogeneous field. These graphic elements make up what I call a ""rhetorical mathematics"" that conveys an impression of rationality. Although theory pictures rarely show much beyond what a text already says in its writing, they simulate a hermeneutic passage from written ideas to an independent representational or mathematical space. The paper discusses two modes of textual disruption of the rhetorical mathematics of theory pictures: parody and deconstruction. Parody makes ironic use of graphic devices in order to expose the rationalistic associations that come with the territory. Deconstruction displaces (and, if taken far enough, dissolves entirely) the Flatland of pictorial rationality. These negative maneuvers raise the possibility of using figural space for alternative modes of sociological inquiry.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/201870,1991,Sociological Theory,10.2307_201870
0,Where History and Sociology Meet: Forms of Discourse and Sociohistorical Inquiry,"Conventionally, proposals to improve working relations between sociology and history have been interdisciplinary. The present essay advances an alternative approach-consolidation of sociohistorical inquiry as a transdisciplinary enterprise. All socio-historical inquiry depends on four elemental forms of discourse: discourse on values, narrative discourse, social theoretical discourse, and the discourse of explanation. Though inquiry is transdisciplinary in the problematics of these discourses, concrete methodology typically is oriented either toward theorization in relation to cases (historical sociology) or toward comprehensive analysis of a single phenomenon (sociological history). Varying the articulated relations among the four forms of discourse once for historical sociology and again for sociological history yields eight ideal typical strategies of inquiry. The four strategies of historical sociology include universal history, theory application, macro-analytic history, and contrast-oriented comparison. The parallel strategies for sociological history are situational history, specific history, configurational history, and historicism. These ideal types offer standard reference points that help clarify the underpinnings of a diverse range of scholarly practices.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/201957,1992,Sociological Theory,10.2307_201957

0,"Race and Theory: Culture, Poverty, and Adaptation to Discrimination in Wilson and Ogbu","This article provides the theoretical resources to resolve a number of conundrums in the work of William Julius Wilson and John Ogbu. Contrary to what Wilson's and Ogbu's work sometimes imply, inner-city blacks are not enmeshed in a ""culture of poverty,"" but rather are generally committed to mainstream values and their normative expectations. Activities that deviate from these values derive from the cognitive expectations inner-city blacks have formed in the face of their restricted legitimate opportunity structures. These expectations, which suggest that educational and occupational success are improbable for inner-city residents, are accurate. If their opportunities were to improve, their cognitive expectations would change and most would be committed to taking advantage of these new opportunities. The differences that separate the inner-city poor from whites center on cultural symbols, which help constitute their identity, sometimes in opposition to the white majority. Most deficiencies in performance among blacks stem not from these cultural attributes, but from the way they are processed in white-dominated organizations. Given a majority commitment to equal opportunity and a majority belief that blacks actually have equal opportunity, many conclude from their performance that blacks are in some sense inferior. This ""new racism"" overdetermines the performance of blacks.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/202096,1999,Sociological Theory,10.2307_202096
0,The (Non) Accumulation of Capital: Explicating the Relationship of Structure and Agency in the Lives of Poor Black Men,"The concepts of habitus and capital are crucial in the research tradition of social and cultural reproduction. This article applies both terms to an analysis of aspects of the life histories of low-income African American men. In exploring how their past experiences relate to their present-day statuses as nonmobile individuals, this article also revisits and redefines the utility of habitus and capital as conceptual devices for the study of social inequality. It expands the empirical terrain covered by the concept of capital to include that which allows low-income individuals to manage their existence in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities while also hindering their mobility in the broader social world. One implication of this approach is an improved cultural analysis of low-income individuals. The improvement lies in that their behavior can be better understood as reflections of their readings of social reality, which are based upon the material and ideational resources that they have accumulated throughout their lives, and not simply as manifestations of flawed value-systems or normative orientations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/202097,1999,Sociological Theory,10.2307_202097
0,Permutation Models for Relational Data,"A common problem in sociology, psychology, biology, geography, and management science is the comparison of dyadic relational structures (i.e., graphs). Where these structures are formed on a common set of elements, a natural question that arises is whether there is a tendency for elements that are strongly connected in one set of structures to be more--or less--strongly connected within another set. We may ask, for instance, whether there is a correspondence between golf games and business deals, trade and warfare, or spatial proximity and genetic similarity. In each case, the data for such comparisons may be continuous or discrete, and multiple relations may be involved simultaneously (e.g., when comparing multiple measures of international trade volume with multiple types of political interactions). We propose here an exponential family of permutation models that is suitable for inferring the direction and strength of association among dyadic relational structures. A linear-time algorithm is shown for MCMC simulation of model draws, as is the use of simulated draws for maximum likelihood estimation (MCMC-MLE) and/or estimation of Monte Carlo standard errors. We also provide an easily performed maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation procedure for the permutation model family, which provides a reasonable means of generating seed models for the MCMC-MLE procedure. Use of the modeling framework is demonstrated via an application involving relationships among managers in a high-tech firm.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20451136,2007,Sociological Methodology,10.2307_20451136
0,"Is Friendship Consistent with Competitive Market Exchange?: A Microsociological Analysis of the Fish Export, Import Business","A conventional assumption within sociology of markets is that social ties are crucial in economic life, but that too strong relationships between sellers and buyers can create role conflicts and restrict business. Using qualitative interviews with Norwegian exporters and Danish importers, this article examines transactions in the international fish trade. We find that the assumed episodic and highly competitive commodity trade is rooted in dyadic networks and personal trust; inspired by the work of Goffman, we analyse transaction patterns as 'interaction order'. The transaction pattern is dependent on a particular organization of social interaction, interaction in which business dealings are divided into delimited spheres of the 'formal', 'personal' and 'private'. This division reflects a differentiation of the social roles, one in which traders avoid the role conflicts inherent in close relationships. We conclude by stating that economic sociology should probably be less preoccupied with formal network configurations and instead be focused more on how actors actually use social ties in the marketplace to conduct business, and on how these ties are linked to price mechanisms.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20459971,2007,Acta Sociologica,10.2307_20459971

The impact on attendance of factors that are experienced by all churches in the city (bad weather, summer, religious holidays, and secular holidays) and factors unique to individual churches (size, if the church is liturgical or nonliturgical, and denominational affiliation) are assessed to determine if all churches experience similar week-to-week fluctuations or if differences exist based on congregational factors.

0,"Health and quality of life of older people, a replication after six years","Replicating a survey of 875 people 55 years old or more undertaken in September 1999 throughout the former Northern Interior Health Region (NIHR) of British Columbia, in September 2005 a sample of 656 people completed a 22-page questionnaire. The average age of the respondents was 68, with a range running from 55 to 96 years, and 64% were women. Responses to the SF-36 questionnaire indicated that for male respondents aged 55-64, the mean score for the 8 dimensions was 76.1. This mean was a bit higher than the 74.4 mean of 1999. For male respondents aged 65 and older the mean was 69.0, which was also higher than the 68.3 mean of 1999. For females aged 55-64, the mean score for 8 dimensions was 73.1, versus 73.0 in 1999. For female respondents aged 65 and older, the mean score was 67.0, versus 65.4 in 1999. Based on these mean scores for the 8 dimensions, then, it is fair to say that the overall health status of males and females aged 55 years and older in the region in 2005 was at least as good as (i.e., the same as or better than) that in 1999. Comparing 28 average figures for the 2005 respondents on satisfaction with specific domains of life (e.g., financial security, health, sense of meaning) and three global indicators (satisfaction with life as a whole and with the overall quality of life, and happiness) with those of the 1999 respondents, we found that the scores for the 2005 sample were at least as high as those of the other sample. Thus, it seems fair to say that the perceived quality of life of older people in the former NIHR so far as it is revealed in domain and global satisfaction and happiness scores, is at least as good as the perceived quality of life of a similar sample in 1999. Although a large majority perceived increases in crime in the 2 year periods prior to both surveys, smaller percentages of the 2005 sample than of the 1999 sample thought that crime had increased over the past two years, avoided going out at night, feared for their safety, had crime-related worries, engaged in crime-related defensive behaviours and were actually the victims of any crimes. Therefore, it seems fair to say that, so far as crime-related issues are concerned for the two samples of seniors responding to our surveys, there is more evidence of improvement than of deterioration. Applying stepwise multiple regression, each of the eight dependent variables was explained on the basis of four clusters of predictors separately and then a final regression was run using only the statistically significant predictors from the four clusters. Broadly speaking, 7 SF-36 health status scales explained from 28% to 45% of the variance in the 8 dependent variables, running from satisfaction with the overall quality of life (28%) to the single item measure of general health (45%). The seven predictors in the Social Relations cluster explained from 7% of the variance in the SF-36 General Health scale scores to 57% of the variance in the Life Satisfaction scores. The four predictors in the Problems cluster explained from 10% of the variance in the SF-36 General Health scale scores to 24% of the variance in the SWLS scores. The 11 predictors in the Domain Satisfaction cluster explained from 14% of the variance in the SF-36 General Health scale scores to 64% of the variance in the SWB scores. Putting all the significant predictors together for each dependent variable, in the weakest case, 4 of 11 potential predictors explained 33% of the variance in the SF-36 General Health scale scores and in the strongest case, 9 of 15 potential predictors explained 70% of the variance in Life Satisfaction scores. Among other things, these results clearly show that respondents' ideas about a generally healthy life are different from, but not independent of, their ideas about a happy, satisfying or contented life, or about the perceived quality of their lives or their subjective wellbeing. Finally, the 7 core discrepancy predictors of MDT plus incomes were used to explain the eight dependent variables. From 13% of the variance in the SF-36 General Health scale scores to 57% of the variance in SWLS scores was explained using those predictors. Based on an examination of the Total Effects scores for the predictors of the 8 dependent variables, the most influential predictors were Self-Wants, followed by Self-Others and then Self-Best. In other words, the most influential discrepancy predictors of respondents' overall life assessments were those between what respondents have versus what they want, followed by what they have versus what others of the same age and sex have, and then by what they have versus the best they ever had in the past.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20734512,2007,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_20734512

0,Ecological and Social Differentials in Mortality: Inequalities by Metropolitan-Nonmetropolitan Residency and Racial Composition,"Studies of differentials in mortality usually have been bivariate and without benefit of a theoretical structure. In this study, mortality is approached through a multivariate framework and conceptualized as an indicator of inequality resulting from differential life chances and styles, which, in turn, reflect general stratification processes. An ecological factor, residency, and a social factor, racial composition, are used to investigate four questions: Do metropolitan counties have lower death rates than nonmetropolitan counties? Does the difference between White and non-White county mortality still favor White counties, and will a racial differential favoring White-designated counties exist when residency status is held constant and when areal social class characteristics are held constant? All counties of the 12-state North Central Region (N = 1056) provide the data. T-test, covariance, and multiple classification analyses are used to investigate the questions. Metropolitan and White counties (with age controlled) displayed lower crude death rates. The latter two questions were answered strongly in the affirmative, indicating, not only that significant residency and racial differences in county mortality exist, but also that, even when controlled for residency status and areal social class, the racial differential persists. Conclusions support the use and conceptualization of mortality as an indicator of inequality. Discussion centers around the persistent racial differential and draws tentatively upon a ""theory of insecurity"" or ""minority group status"" hypothesis for explanation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20831105,1979,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20831105
0,TALCOTT PARSONS: THE SOCIAL RELATIONS OF INDIVIDUALISM AND ECONOMY,"Talcott Parsons' critique of utilitarian individualism, possessive forms of property and contract, and instrumentalism provides grounds for a relational and nonreductive analysis of individualism and economy. Rather than defining individualism and economic action through possessions and market relations, individuals and such core economic categories as property, wealth, contract, and profit are established through differentiating social processes, interactions among institutions, and integrative norms and values. Instead of leading to atomism, overdetermination, or an exogenous overlay of norms on instrumental rationality, relational and reflective dimensions of concepts for the analysis of economic action are paramount. A critical appropriation of these concepts provides an expansive view of individualism and economic action, emphasizing the integration of economic and noneconomic factors in shaping economic action. The paper concludes by illustrating these themes empirically.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20832256,2005,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20832256
0,Time Dependence in Micro Social Interaction: An Elaboration of Information Exchange Theory and Initial Empirical Test,"Many micro sociological theories describe social interaction as a process, implying the importance of time. Yet, time is seriously undertheorized and underanalyzed in micro social interaction. We show that time plays a conceptually relevant role in information exchange theory. According to this theory, when actors contribute some types of information (like ideas) to a group, they are more likely to be negatively evaluated than if they contribute other types (like positive evaluations). Information exchange theory conceptualizes information types that are more prone to be met with negative evaluation as more socially risky than those less prone to negative evaluation, since negative evaluations engender status loss for recipients. The theory posits that actors manage interaction to reduce social risk by avoiding more risky information initiations, especially when conditions are such that the likelihood of negative evaluations occurring in a group is particularly high. We propose that when higher risk information types are dense in the temporal space of interaction, then the likelihood of negative evaluation is higher, exacerbating the risk of these information types (and consequently, the likelilhood of their occurrence declines). When lower risk information types are sparse in the temporal space of interaction, the likelihood of their occurrence increases as actors try to reduce the potential for conflict in social interaction. We use event history methods to test these claims on the role of time. Results not only support our contentions regarding the importance of time but also show that it is a crucial regulator of social interaction.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20832325,2007,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20832325
0,"From Class Consciousness to Culture, Action, and Social Organization","For much of the postwar period in the United States, sociological research on class consciousness has tended to be limited to and by survey methods, with the result that class consciousness has been viewed as a static, individuated phenomenon, abstracted from social action and the context of class practices. However, in recent years a body of work has developed, often based upon the concept of class formation rather than the ideationally bound concept of class consciousness, that holds more promise. By drawing upon historical, ethnographic, and participant observation techniques, this work challenges conventional approaches and points toward promising new directions for future research.

Results of the analysis indicated that cross-sectional variations in the rate of circulatory mobility per se were unrelated to the energy-consumption measure. Insofar as the rate of observed mobility covaried with energy consumption, it was because of historical features of the structure of production in the several countries--specifically, the extent to which productivity involved a large labor-intensive agricultural sector during the time of the fathers and the extent to which the structure of production (as represented in the distribution of occupational ranks) changed during the interval of the father-son comparisons.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2094256,1971,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2094256

0,Interaction Preludes to Role Setting: Exploratory Local Action,"In most settings, roles are given and role behavior is a salient ideal for retaining status. Yet in settings that admit only like actors, coveted roles often can only be acquired through interaction. During the interaction prelude to role setting, claiming a coveted role through unilateral role behavior is strategically vulnerable. A distinct action ideal, called local action, is needed to avoid role claims until there is evidence a claimed role will be conferred. Ironically, local action suppresses role differentiation when used by both sides in interaction. The exchange of local actions yields a self-perpetuating prelude, or stable balance, between actors who each seek coveted roles that would put the other in less desirable complementary roles. Local action thereby provides an explanation for balanced reciprocity and casts new light on balance as a purely local phenomenon. No longer must generalized role behavior (i.e., the norm of reciprocity) be invoked where roles are not given. The coexistence of two salient ideals (local action and role behavior) should alert us to discontinuities in behavior as settings and ideals change, as well as to the pockets of ambiguity that are a part of larger role structures.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095896,1985,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2095896

Network density and size influence collective action outcomes in dramatically different ways, depending on the structural position of those who make unconditional contributions. Moreover, these effects are highly nonlinear, suggesting that the impact of social ties on collective action may be quite sensitive to mobilization contexts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095965,1978,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2095965

I investigate four main questions: (1) how the base of power (reward or punishment) affects the relation between outcomes and satisfaction; (2) how within- and between-relation outcome comparisons affect satisfaction in negatively-connected exchange networks; (3) how dynamic exchange processes, net of exchange outcomes, affect satisfaction; and (4) how actors' positions of power affect each of these relations. Based on a theoretical analysis of how the structure, process, and outcomes of exchange should affect actors' expectations, I test predictions of their effects on satisfaction.

Perceived threat is hypothesized to be a function of economic conditions and of the size of the subordinate group relative to the dominant group. I test the group-threat theory using a multilevel model that combines population data with survey results on attitudes towards immigrants and racial minorities from Eurobarometer Survey 30. ""Group threat"" explains most of the variation in average prejudice scores across the 12 countries in the sample and has a small but statistically significant effect on the influence of certain individual-level variables on prejudice. These results demonstrate the importance of perceived intergroup threat in the formation of prejudicial attitudes and suggest a re-interpretation of past findings on the relations between individual characteristics and expressions of prejudice.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096296,1978,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096296

Data were obtained from samples of black students and white students in all 11 public high schools of Indianapolis, Indiana. Measures of academic outcomes include students' effort, grades, and achievement scores. Contrary to much of the thinking in the literature, attending predominately white classes did not benefit black students most when their white peers came from high-status families or had high academic values. Rather, attending mostly-white classes was associated with higher effort among blacks whose peers were from lower-education families and were not academically oriented.

Homeless men appear at greater risk of exhibiting symptoms. Nonetheless, homeless women report more symptoms, a result consistent with general population trends. Predisposing illnesses were the most accurate predictors of the number of reported symptoms, but gender explained a significant amount of variation in reported symptoms after other health risks were controlled. The findings inform the debate on the relative importance of biological factors, acquired risks, illness perception and behavior, and reporting bias in explaining why women report more symptoms in survey research. It appears likely that female reporting bias and gender differences in illness perception are underestimated in general population surveys because even under extreme conditions, men are less likely than women to report symptoms.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136798,1987,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_2136798

For the sample as a whole, support was found for a social selection process, since psychological distress predicted decreases in primary, but not secondary, social relationships. The extent of primary relationships also were found to be associated with subsequent distress, providing evidence that the relationship between mental health and social environment may be transactional. When examined separately by gender, males but not females were found to be vulnerable to the process of social selection, supporting the hypothesis that the expression of distress is less role-appropriate for men and therefore more likely to invite social sanctions.

0,Social Support from Friends and Psychological Distress Among Elderly Persons: Moderator Effects of Age,"In this study, the relationships among age, sex, friend support, and psychological distress are examined among elderly persons. Structural equation modeling and a longitudinal design are used to examine direct, indirect, and moderator (interaction) effects over a 22-month interval. Findings suggest that different causal processes operate among persons over the age of 70 (old-old) and those 50 to 70 years (young-old); the cross-lagged effects of friend support on distress and of distress on friend support are only observed in the older group. Compared to the young-old, the old-old receive less friend support at time 2 (T2) if they experienced psychological distress at time 1 (T1), and the old-old are more distressed at T2 if they received low levels of support at T1. As a result of this age interaction, the total effects of sex on distress and support at T2 are twice as large in the sample of old-old persons as in the sample of young-old persons. Such findings suggest that the old-old in general and old-old men in particular are especially vulnerable to psychological distress when losing friend support, and to lose friend support when experiencing psychological distress.

0,Cultural Anchors and the Organization of Differences: A Multi-method Analysis of LGBT Marches on Washington,"Social scientists describe culture as either coherent or incoherent and political dissent as either unifying or divisive. This article moves beyond such dichotomies. Content, historical, and network analyses of public debates on how to organize four lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Washington marches provide evidence for an integrative position. Rather than just describe consistencies or contradictions, we contend that the key analytic challenge is to explain the organization of differences. We propose one way of doing this using the mechanism of a cultural anchor. Within and across marches, a small collection of ideas remains fixed in the national conversation, yet in a way that allows activists to address their internal diversity and respond to unfolding historical events. These results suggest that activists do not simply organize around their similarities but, through cultural anchors, they use their commonalities to build a thinly coherent foundation that can also support their differences. Situated at the nexus of culture, social movements, sexualities, and networks, this article demonstrates how the anchoring mechanism works in the context of LGBT political organizing.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23018942,2011,American Sociological Review,10.2307_23018942
0,WOMAN'S STATUS IN SOCIALISTIC AND CAPITALISTIC COUNTRIES (II),"The aim of the article is to determine whether analyses of available statistical data show substantial differences in women's situations in socialistic countries in comparison with capitalistic ones. Part one of the article presents general demographic data such as population by sex and age, marital status, maternity, and female-male education in socialistic and capitalistic countries. In part two the writer makes detailed comparisons between female nad male professional activity, and discusses women's and men's crime and suicide rates. Women's professional activity is a little higher in socialistic countries than in capitalistic ones. A more thorough analysis shows that this difference is due to women's very high participation in agriculture, in socialistic countries—in comparison with women's mostly low agricultural activity in capitalistic countries. Statistical data from many countries, and some detailed figures from Poland (as an example) indicate that the high supremacy of men, especially in the field of economic activity still exists in both systems. The general, final conclusion is that available statistical data do not indicate that women's situations in capitalistic and socialistic countries differ substantially. The analyses indirectly suggest, that ""Women's emancipation and/or liberation is still far-away from being a social reality, both in capitalistic and socialistic countries.""",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23027020,1971,International Journal of Sociology of the Family,10.2307_23027020

The shi-shi movement helped create the revolutionary situation which culminated in Japan's Meiji Restoration (1868). Violence was prominent and consequential in the shi-shi movement and was found throughout the career of the movement. This study of a single case is by no means sufficient to claim primacy over existing models of the place of violence in social movements.

It asks why the traditional Incarnation feast has been overwhelmed by intense commercial cooptation and economic rationalization. In pursuit of some of the roots of this institutionalized activity an effort is made to grasp the place of economic surplus (those goods left over after basic subsistence needs have been cared for) in human society. Religious control and direction of surplus, sacredly interpreted, produced a complex of ethical postulates aimed at development of restraints on practices considered as self-aggrandizing in a material way. Pre-Christian and Christian practices up to the Reformation seem to be as one on this issue. The Reformation and movements which arose in conjunction with it seem to have revised this ancient system of material restraint. Modern Christmas appears to be a manifestation of a new complex of attitudes regarding use of economic surplus. Gift-giving is central and conjecturally considered as a phenomenon which reveals some of the meaning of this national period of festivity; festivity aimed at honoring the productiveness of the American economic system. There is also an attempt made to judge the power of the 'work ethic' as a fundamental construct involved in the processes of the American culture's magnification of Christmas as its greatest moment of prodigal exuberance.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23261799,1977,Humboldt Journal of Social Relations,10.2307_23261799
0,TOWARD A FORMAL STATEMENT OF HOMANS' SOCIAL EXCHANGE PROPOSITIONS,"A formal restatement of Homans' social exchange propositions is suggested as necessary in order to assess the predictive accuracy of the theory. Several issues of formal theory construction (e.g., types of terms and statements, rules of derivation) are discussed. Previous criticisms of Homans' propositions as tautological and untestable are discounted. However, a reassessment of Homans' propositions requires the specification of units of analysis, temporal relations between variables, and operational definitions of the value concept.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23262144,1977,Humboldt Journal of Social Relations,10.2307_23262144

0,For a postcolonial sociology,"Postcolonial theory has enjoyed wide influence in the humanities but it has left sociology comparatively unscathed. Does this mean that postcolonial theory is not relevant to sociology? Focusing upon social theory and historical sociology in particular, this article considers if and how postcolonial theory in the humanities might be imported into North American sociology. It argues that postcolonial theory offers a substantial critique of sociology because it alerts us to sociology's tendency to analytically bifurcate social relations. The article also suggests that a postcolonial sociology can overcome these problems by incorporating relational social theories to give new accounts of modernity. Rather than simply studying non-Western postcolonial societies or only examining colonialism, this approach insists upon the interactional constitution of social units, processes, and practices across space. To illustrate, the article draws upon relational theories (actor-network theory and field theory) to offer postcolonial accounts of two conventional research areas in historical sociology: the industrial revolution in England and the French Revolution.",external-fulltext-any,2013,Theory and Society,10.2307_23362893

Two Annotated Poems for a More Literary, Poetic Sociology","While literature and sociology are separately signifying, discursive practices, their use in unison has been limited to either the sociology of literature or a sociology through literature. This article, while demonstrating these two approaches as doubly mistaken, innovates — with two annotated poems — a more or most literary, poetic sociology where the self-deconstructive writing that happens in the event of a poem, undergoes a destructive mutation being contaminated by the social: they cannot be sundered in annotation, cannot be gleaned from a unity a priori.

0,Thinking Inside and Outside of the Circle of Kings: Reflections on the Comparative and Performative Practice of Southeast Asian Studies,"Evaluations of the success, viability, and future of Southeast Asian studies in the United States have long been characterized by pessimis, and also by a set of deeply rooted assumptions about what an area studies programme is supposed to be and what it requires to be successful. These assumptions concern not just institutional issues, but conceptions of what makes a region a proper unit for scholarly analysis, conceptions that invariably hinge on explicit or implicit comparisons to other regions. In this essay, I reverse the gaze of such evaluations by turning some of O.W. Wolter's classic notions about Southeast Asian cultures back upon the practice of Southeast Asianists, and by reversing some of the comparisons that are often used to demarcate Southeast Asia as both as distinctive region and a distinctively weak subject for successful area studies. Rather than accept such abstract and a priori notions about what Southeast Asian studies must be and what must be wrong with it, I propose instead a much more expansive, inclusive, and flexible definition of the field based upon the way it is practised in particular places and times. Such a performative model of Southeast Asian studies can take students, pedagogy, diaspora, and diverse transnational flows into account, while emphasizing all the more the importance of Southeast Asia as a field of scholarly and institutional collaboration.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23654345,2005,Asian Journal of Social Science,10.2307_23654345
0,"Exploring Practical Horizons of Beyond Sociology: Structure, Agency, and Strategy among Tenants in India","A theoretical orientation toward 'strategies' is proposed in this paper. This theoretical approach suggests that we study both the context for immediate decision-making and the broader context in which reflection and deliberation occur. Whilst these are very broad concerns, the paper itself is based on fieldwork about land rental relationships in rural South India. The paper introduces strategies as a solution to the theorists' dilemma of choice vs. constraints. We treat tenants (as both households and as individual agents) in their structural contexts whilst respecting the complexity and co-mutuality of their agency. The strategies that people use involve an orientation to current and future events, including possible events which are imagined or which could happen. Both structural relationships and concrete past incidents act as reference points for decisions made today in a given relationship. The strategies of tenants include being pliable vis-à-vis landlords but some tenants make this conditional upon landlords' proper behaviour. Agents negotiate and enforce proper behaviour and, thus, both create and change the system of norms that exists. In Macintyre's terms (1985), the virtues intrinsic to the socio-economic practices are continually being re-worked. The theory of strategies reframes 'virtue' in dynamic structure-and-agency terms. Agents are not simply individuals. The debate about rational choice vs. holism can be augmented by looking at agency supra-individualistically. The strategy of a household is an emergent property of the household as an agent. It includes detailed first-order strategies along with more reflective second-order strategies which reconcile goals in the education, migration, household work, and marriage domains. The paper is, thus, interdisciplinary and contributes to sociology, while pluralistically drawing upon other disciplines.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23655204,2009,Asian Journal of Social Science,10.2307_23655204
0,Communists like us: Ethnicized modernity and the idea of 'the West' in the Soviet Union,"This article offers a portrait of communism in the USSR as an ethnicized form of modernity; a form defined in relation to the idea of 'the West'. First, I introduce the 'racialized modernity' thesis and suggest that notions of race and racialization are neither adequate nor appropriate categories to apply to the reification of modernity in the USSR. I then turn to western views of Russia, emphasizing the role accorded to Russians of the 'not quite European' Europeans. These two sections provide the background to a discussion of the development of an ethnopolitical form of communist modernity — a form in which the proletariat was simultaneously an ethnic and political category — which is introduced in the rest of the article. Section six is somewhat different, charting the abandonment of the communist vision. The so-called 'return to Europe', although a supposedly stalled and certainly an ambiguous process, is presented here in terms of the reanimation of western and Russian myths of communism as a non-European 'hiatus' in Russian history. Central to this process is the ethnic othering of communism through its representation as an Asian contamination of western tradition.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23890186,2002,Ethnicities,10.2307_23890186
0,"Immigration, social cohesion, and naturalization","The standard appeal to social cohesion in relation to immigration concerns admittance and residence. But social cohesion is sometimes also invoked as a relevant concern in relation to the attainment of citizenship in the state through naturalization. Many western states have recently tightened conditions for naturalization and introduced tougher language requirements and knowledge of society tests. The article discusses how concerns for social cohesion might function as a part of justifications of such restrictive naturalization requirements. It argues that standard concerns with generalized social trust do not connect with issues of naturalization at all. Other conceptions of social cohesion are either politically controversial, problematic as part of the justification of stricter naturalization requirements, or in fact justify less demanding naturalization requirements.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23890262,2010,Ethnicities,10.2307_23890262
0,SOCIAL CAPITAL IN THE PHILIPPINES: RESULTS FROM A NATIONAL SURVEY,"Two major notions of social capital, namely networks and trust, take center stage in this review of findings from a national survey conducted by the Social Weather Stations. The major findings fall into three general themes: first, the pervasiveness in Philippine society of network contacts with close family and friends, or bonding social capital; second, the paucity of associational ties, or bridging social capital, among adult Filipinos; and third, the asymmetry of social capital, in that those who bond more and trust more are more likely to come from the ranks of the privileged. These findings suggest that discussions on social capital, in concept and practice, must take into account the sociological forces that lay down the blueprints for distributing scarce goods in society.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23898129,2005,Philippine Sociological Review,10.2307_23898129
0,Changing the Discourse on Return Migrants: Cosmopolitanism and the Reintegration of Return Filipino Migrant Domestic Workers,"Recent literature on cosmopolitanism have begun to examine its emergence among the working classes, taking into account their increased transnational mobility in a globalized world. Labor migrants in particular have been seen to acquire cosmopolitan sensibilities in the course of migration as contact zones and cultural exchanges multiply. This paper presents a grounded attempt in approaching the concept of cosmopolitanism as it is negotiated in the return and reintegration of Filipino migrant domestic workers. It highlights the spatialization of cosmopolitanism as returnees find that cosmopolitan identities cannot easily be transplanted in their home countries. Migrant domestic workers are able to practice cosmopolitanism abroad, even within the context of capitalist-labor relations, in their consumption of cultural products and participation in class-based leisure activities within the context of a developed country, and in their cultural learning. However, the practice of cosmopolitanism in return has been constrained by place. Interviewees return to villages and not to cities, and the need to readapt to the norms and values of the community as well as the desire to be reintegrated, have led to a realignment of identities in favor of household and community expectations, although interviewees still construct themselves as more 'modern' and 'foreign' in their ways. This paper argues that the recognition of return migrant domestic workers as cosmopolitan would not only provide a more nuanced picture of reintegration needs but would also harness their ideas for the development of their communities.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23902930,2008,Philippine Sociological Review,10.2307_23902930

Drawing on empirical research, it examines some of the tensions which crystallise around intimate fatherhood and the meanings and practices of family photography. Focusing on the visual and how this can shed light on different dimensions of everyday experience, it explores how parents set boundaries around notions of decency and adjudge appropriate behaviour, with particular attention to the (in) significance of children's age and the impact of class and social context. Notwithstanding cultural changes which prize intimate fatherhood, the management of masculinity and the paternal body remain a source of anxiety. This article interrogates how gender and ideas of 'risk management' are shaping embodied interactions between fathers and children and thus what children are learning about men, masculinity and intimacy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24433223,2013,Sociology,10.2307_24433223

These points of contact between early sociological and neoliberalism are addressed in detail in order to consider the challenges that the latter poses to sociological thought. It is argued that because the neoliberal project developed out of an epistemological and political critique of classical ideas of the 'social', this places sociology in a position of strength to advance a critical response to the intellectual basis of neoliberalism.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24433705,2014,Sociology,10.2307_24433705

It is argued that the structure and content of the chapter can be explained as an attempt to present a conceptual framework for the analysis of the genesis and the development of the modern rational business enterprise, rather than being intended as a general introduction to economic sociology. Three features of Weber's theory of the modern business enterprise are found to be of potential relevance for recent sociological theory: the distinction between two ideal types of rational economic action – budgetary management and profit-making; the analysis of the tensions between formal and substantive rationality; and the analysis of the institutional embeddedness of the modern business enterprise. Weber's theory of the modern business enterprise may be seen as an important, but still unexplored, result of his lifelong studies of the causes of modern capitalism.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24579609,2002,Max Weber Studies,10.2307_24579609

This paper reconsiders Weber's thought in the light of his two-decade-long preoccupation with the methodological and substantive issues raised by that debate. It presents Weber's culminating contribution, the 1909 edition of The Agrarian Sociology of Ancient Civilisations, as a resolution of 'Marx's paradox' as well as his most rounded attempt to overcome the tension between history and theory in accordance with the approach advocated in the methodological essays of 1903–1906.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24579713,2000,Max Weber Studies,10.2307_24579713
0,Filipino Maritime Students and Seafarers: Defying Dominant Social Imaginaries,"This article explores the lives of Filipino maritime students and seafarers through the analysis of creative productions, such as photographs, artwork, video music and an accompanying ethnographic work. The study analyses 90 photographs consisting of 60 images sent as entries to a photography contest and 30 images retrieved from a Facebook page dedicated to seafarers. These images were used in photo elicitation interviews with seafarers and maritime students to capture their narratives. The research is a critique of how the capitalist system exploits seafarers and maritime students by selling the narrative that seafaring is a profitable profession while veiling the constricting working conditions onboard and that maritime education continues to be promising despite the oversupply of seafarers in the labor market. I draw on the work of Cornelius Castoriadis (1922-1997) through the notion of social imaginaries as knowledge or sets of ideas and perceptions of social life, based on tangible but selected realities. These realities consist of dominant and convenient discourses, dreams, illusions, and desires. The hazard of the capitalist imaginary lies in its presentation as rational that in turn persuades social individuals to adhere to this imaginary in order to benefit from the promise of progress. However the individuals' psyche or imaginary capacity can also enhance their agency through the construction of alternatives that humanize their social conditions. In this article, seafarers are presented as capable of defying or transgressing the dominant imaginaries of society through their own alternative imaginaries.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24717159,2015,Philippine Sociological Review,10.2307_24717159

0,Disparities in Academic Achievement: Assessing the Role of Habitus and Practice,"Bourdieu's theory of cultural and social reproduction—with its core concepts cultural capital, habitus, practice and field—is a leading account of the intergenerational persistence of educational inequality. Although numerous studies examine the relationship between class, cultural capital and academic outcomes, and some focus on gender differences in cultural capital, few attempt to operationalize Bourdieu's accompanying concepts of habitus and practice, and to consider gender differences along these dimensions. The present study addresses these gaps by examining a ""structure-disposition-practice"" model of the relationships between family socioeconomic status (SES), sex, habitus, academic practices, and academic achievement using multilevel Canadian data. Findings of SES and gender differences in the model offer qualified support for the potential of Bourdieu's framework to help increase our understanding of class and gender disparities in educational outcomes. Results suggest that habitus, practice and the ""structure-disposition-practice"" model are not only theoretically sophisticated, but also empirically sustainable and that future efforts to more precisely measure the model's concepts and relationships are warranted.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24720249,2013,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_24720249
0,Estimating the Effect of Perceived Risk of Crime on Social Trust in the Presence of Endogeneity Bias,"This study aims to estimate the effect of perceived risk of crime on the social trust probability for Italian men and women, accounting for both observed and unobserved confounding. We use microdata collected by the Italian National Statistical Office for the year 2010 during a multi-scope survey of Italian households. The relationship under investigation is estimated after controlling for observed confounding by using a propensity score weighting approach. To control for both observed and unobserved confounding (better known as endogeneity), a semiparametric recursive bivariate probit approach is ultimately employed instead. Our findings show that the perceived risk of crime has a significant negative effect on the social trust probability regardless of gender and that endogeneity seems to be present for both genders. The paper represents the first such application in which the effect of interest is estimated accounting for the presence of endogeneity.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24720262,2013,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_24720262

0,Tradition and Innovation in Scientists' Research Strategies,"What factors affect a scientist's choice of research problem? Qualitative research in the history and sociology of science suggests that this choice is patterned by an ""essential tension"" between productive tradition and risky innovation. We examine this tension through Bourdieu's field theory of science, and we explore it empirically by analyzing millions of biomedical abstracts from MEDLINE. We represent the evolving state of chemical knowledge with networks extracted from these abstracts. We then develop a typology of research strategies on these networks. Scientists can introduce novel chemicals and chemical relationships (innovation) or delve deeper into known ones (tradition). They can consolidate knowledge clusters or bridge them. The aggregate distribution of published strategies remains remarkably stable. High-risk innovation strategies are rare and reflect a growing focus on established knowledge. An innovative publication is more likely to achieve high impact than a conservative one, but the additional reward does not compensate for the risk of failing to publish. By studying prizewinners in biomedicine and chemistry, we show that occasional gambles for extraordinary impact are a compelling explanation for observed levels of risky innovation. Our analysis of the essential tension identifies institutional forces that sustain tradition and suggests policy interventions to foster innovation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24756349,2015,American Sociological Review,10.2307_24756349
0,"""No Fracking Way!"" Documentary Film, Discursive Opportunity, and Local Opposition against Hydraulic Fracturing in the United States, 2010 to 2013","Recent scholarship highlights the importance of public discourse for the mobilization and impact of social movements, but it neglects how cultural products may shift discourse and thereby influence mobilization and political outcomes. This study investigates how activism against hydraulic fracturing (""fracking"") utilized cultural artifacts to influence public perceptions and effect change. A systematic analysis of Internet search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states. These results have implications not only for understanding movement outcomes, but also for theory and research on media, the environment, and energy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24756351,2015,American Sociological Review,10.2307_24756351

0,Indicators of Climate Change in Idaho:,"Climate change is well documented at the global scale, but local and regional changes are not as well understood. Finer, local- to regional-scale information is needed for creating specific, place-based planning and adaption efforts. Here the development of an indicator-focused climate change assessment in Idaho is described. This interdisciplinary framework couples end users’ data needs with observed, biophysical changes at local to regional scales. An online statewide survey of natural resource professionals was conducted to assess the perceived impacts from climate change and determine the biophysical data needed to measure those impacts. Changes to water resources and wildfire risk were the highest areas of concern among resource professionals. Guided by the survey results, 15 biophysical indicator datasets were summarized that included direct climate metrics (e.g., air temperature) and indicators only partially influenced by climate (e.g.,wildfire).Quantitative changes in indicators were determined using time series analysis from 1975 to 2010. Indicators displayed trends of varying likelihood over the analysis period, including increasing growing-season length, increasing annual temperature, increasing forest area burned, changing mountain bluebird and lilac phenology, increasing precipitation intensity, earlier center of timing of streamflow, and decreased 1 April snowpack; changes in volumetric streamflow, salmon migration dates, and stream temperature displayed the least likelihood. A final conceptual framework derived from the social and biophysical data provides an interdisciplinary case example useful for consideration by others when choosing indicators at local to regional scales for climate change assessments.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24907455,2015,"Weather, Climate, and Society",10.2307_24907455

Data from 22 215 games, spanning the 2000–11 regular seasons, were studied. Temperature was categorized as “cold,” “average,” and “warm.” Analyses were performed on the following populations: all Major League Baseball games, games played in the National League, games played in the American League, and games played in 23 different stadiums that are currently being used by Major League Baseball teams. Home and away teams’ performances were analyzed separately for each population of games. The results of this study show that runs scored, batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, and home runs significantly increase while walks significantly decrease in warm weather compared to cold weather.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24907533,2013,"Weather, Climate, and Society",10.2307_24907533
0,How Cultural Tastes Shape Personal Networks,"This article examines the relationship between different forms of cultural taste and the density of social contacts across alternative types of network relations classified by average tie strength. The author builds on Bourdieu's ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the ""forms of capital"" (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio's (1987) connection between cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes that (1) in addition to cultural tastes being determined by network relations, cultural tastes are used to form and sustain those networks. Furthermore he expects that (2) highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be converted into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles due to its more restricted, ""asset-specific"" nature. Because of its generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be more likely to be associated with weak-tie network density. The results broadly support these hypotheses: a model that specifies an effect of culture on network density provides a better fit to the data than the traditional conception of networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that popular culture consumption has a positive impact on weak-tie network density but not strong-tie network density, while highbrow culture consumption selectively increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables. These findings help to shed light on the mechanisms that translate mastery of different types of cultural knowledge into integration across distant social positions or closure around strong group boundaries. The author also discusses the implications of the results for current models describing the transformation of cultural into social resources.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25472427,2006,American Sociological Review,10.2307_25472427

0,Explaining the Paradox of Puerto Rican Segregation,"Previous research has shown that Puerto Ricans are highly segregated from non-Hispanic whites and moderately segregated from blacks, with socioeconomic factors having no effect on these patterns. These findings are opposite those observed for other Hispanic groups and contradict the fundamental tenets of ecological theory. This paper explains these anomalous patterns and brings results for Puerto Ricans into conformity with prior theory and research on residential segregation. The Puerto Rican anomaly stems from their very low SES and their black ancestry. Low social status leads directly to high segregation, while a high percent of blacks among Puerto Ricans draws them strongly towards residence near non-Hispanic blacks. Since Anglos avoid living near blacks, Puerto Ricans become bystander victims of Anglos' racial prejudice, leading to their residential segregation in society.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2578643,1973,Social Forces,10.2307_2578643

The study utilizes a set of newly devised measures that allow for the quantification of musical structure; these measures approach music as a symbolic code.

In the 1980s, however, tuitions rose sharply and public financial support for higher education declined. This reversal may have increased the relative importance of social background for college entry. Analysis of High School and Beyond 1980 sophomores suggests that in the 1980s social background became more important for college entry than for high school completion. This finding both captures the experience of more recent cohorts and implies that the previous pattern of declining background effects cannot be understood as primarily the result of selective attrition of the disadvantaged.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580411,1988,Social Forces,10.2307_2580411
0,Nations and Novels: Cultural Politics and Literary Use,"A comparative analysis of 184 Canadian and American popular and high-culture novels suggests the inadequacy of the traditional understanding of national literary differences as reflecting unique national characters. I present an alternative understanding of national literatures that considers variation in production contexts and literary use across types of literature. In brief, I argue that popular-culture novels differ little between the Canada and the U.S. precisely because they are shaped by similar mass-market strategies and read by similar audiences. My data on the cross-national differences in the timing and content of canonical literatures, on the other hand, suggests that such novels have a highly symbolic value tied to the development of the nation-state and are shaped by elite interests in national identity construction.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580448,1981,Social Forces,10.2307_2580448

0,Core Networks and Tie Activation: What Kinds of Routine Networks Allocate Resources in Nonroutine Situations?,"Social resources research has linked activated ties to outcomes-but not to the core networks from which the ties came. This study shifts the focus to the question of how networks allocate resources. The activation of core network ties is analyzed in a nonroutine situation-a hurricane-to determine how core network structure affects the degree to which individuals activate core network ties to gain one type of social resource-informal support. Results show that the structures of individuals' core networks affect the degree to which individuals activate ties from those networks to gain informal support. Individuals embedded in higher-density core networks (i.e., alters are connected to one another), core networks with more gender diversity (i.e., a mix of men and women), and networks that contain higher proportions of men, kin, and younger individuals, activated core network ties for informal support to a greater degree than did individuals embedded in core networks lacking these characteristics. The conclusions consider the study's implications for understanding resource activation in the contexts of social support and job searches.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657385,1987,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657385
0,Choice Shift and Group Polarization,"I extend the theoretical domain of sociology into an area of social psychology that heretofore has been the exclusive domain of psychologists. Specifically, I develop a social structural perspective on the choice shifts that individuals make within groups. During interpersonal discussions of issues, choice shifts occur when there is a difference between group members' mean final opinion and their mean initial opinion. Explanations of choice shifts have emphasized group-level conditions (e.g., a norm, a decision rule, a pool of persuasive arguments, a distribution of initial opinions). I argue that choice shifts are a ubiquitous product of the inequalities of interpersonal influence that emerge during discussions of issues. Hence, I bring choice shifts squarely into the domain of a structural social psychology that attends to the composition of networks of interpersonal influence and into broader sociological perspectives concerned with the formation of status structures.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657407,1992,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657407
0,Power in Negotiated and Reciprocal Exchange,"While classical exchange theorists excluded bargaining from the scope of their theories, most contemporary theorists have done the opposite, concentrating exclusively on negotiated exchanges with binding agreements. We analyze how the form of social exchange-negotiated or reciprocal-affects the distribution of power in exchange networks. These two forms of exchange differ in fundamental ways that affect how actors use power and the kinds of risk and uncertainty they face. We predict that these basic differences will affect the relation between the availability of alternative partners and actors' use of power, and will produce lower power use in reciprocal exchange than in negotiated exchange. We test our predictions in a laboratory experiment. The results support the underlying logic of our theory, partially support its specific predictions, and raise new questions about the importance of the different time perspectives required by negotiated and reciprocal exchange.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657408,1993,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657408
0,The Structure and Dynamics of Movement Participation,We develop a dynamic network model of collective action that explains how collective action can arise in the absence of selective incentives or disincentives from the voluntary action of rational actors in large groups. We show that the search for balance in social interaction among interdependent actors can yield a cascade of activism and result in a successful social movement. The characteristics of actors critical for movement success are identified. We also explore the structural conditions underlying a successful cascade of activism and thus identify the social dynamics of and the structural conditions for collective action in human society.,https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657453,1978,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657453
0,Risk and Power Use: Constraints on the Use of Coercion in Exchange,"I investigate how risk and fear of loss constrain the use of coercive power in nonnegotiated social exchange relations. An analysis of the use of strategic power helps explain why exchange partners in previous research have rarely used coercive power, even when their incentives and capacities to coerce were high. Using power is risky, and actors fear losses from the potential retaliation of their partners far more than they value the prospect of increased rewards. The risks of coercive power use are especially great in the context of relations of mutual exchange because of the high reward dependence of actors who have the strongest incentive to use coercion. Two experiments show that when risk is reduced, particularly the risk of reward loss, both the use of coercion and the effects of variations in the structure of coercive power increase.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657455,1995,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657455
0,Beyond Individual Differences: Social Differentiation from First Principles,"I seek to explain the emergence of social differentiation by developing a theory of information and social structure. This theory makes explanations of social differentiation offered by Spencer and Durkheim more precise by borrowing simple assumptions from Carley's constructural model and from the symbolic interactionist perspective. My arguments amplify an important insight of the classical theorists: No assumption of individual differences is necessary to explain the emergence of social differentiation. Computer simulations show that simple assumptions about interaction patterns, communication, the social construction of knowledge, and forgetting imply that originally undifferentiated social systems will become differentiated over time. The simulations show that system size negatively affects cultural homogeneity and positively affects social differentiation. Memory, or the capacity of individuals to store information, is determined by the information technologies individuals have at their disposal. Memory positively affects cultural homogeneity and negatively affects social differentiation. Memory also positively affects the size of integrated social systems such as organizations and societies. I consider implications of this theory for the origins of sociodemographic dimensions, the study of inequality, and the sociology of culture.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657552,1987,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657552
0,Detection and Determinants of Bias in Subjective Measures,"Many concepts in sociology are difficult or impossible to objectively measure. This limitation forces a reliance on subjective measures that typically contain both systematic and random measurement errors. Systematic errors, or ""biases,"" are the focus of this paper. Campbell and Fiske's (1959) multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) research design is the best known social scientific procedure for uncovering systematic errors, but the data requirements for classical MTMM designs are too demanding for many areas of sociology in which secondary data are the norm. We show that the benefits of the MTMM design are available under more relaxed conditions. In addition, we illustrate how researchers can examine the determinants of systematic errors and gain insights into the potential for confounding or spurious effects caused by systematic errors. We demonstrate the usefulness of these methods using the subjective measures of liberal democracy used in several recent ASR papers and provide additional examples, including measures of the reputational quality of graduate programs and job evaluations for comparable-worth investigations. We conclude that sociologists can do far more to understand the systematic error present in their subjective variables.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657559,1990,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657559
0,Lines of Power in Exchange Networks,"Network exchange theory (NET) predicts differences in the resource accumulations of positions in interconnected groups of actors. The theory distinguishes between two types of networks-strong and weak power. To date only a few studies have tested the theory under weak power conditions. In the present research we investigate six line networks that contain elements of both strong and weak power. Line networks have been particularly important in theories of social exchange and the importance of linear exchange is frequently reflected in natural settings. Four of the investigated lines are longer than any previously studied. We introduce new experimental features designed to minimize extraneous factors, thereby optimizing the translation of structural power differences into observable profit differentials. Results generally support the idea that longer lines may contain elements of both strong and weak power. Most notably, while positions identified as high strong power do obtain approximately 70% or more of resources, there is evidence that a nonzero likelihood of exclusion in the central position of the 7-line may decrease its power.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2675536,1987,Social Forces,10.2307_2675536

0,An Evaluation of Socially Responsive Planning in a New Resource Town,"New resource towns on the Canadian frontier have presented planners with opportunities to experiment with innovative planning ideas which attempt to resolve the persistent problems of such communities. In the planning of Tumbler Ridge, a new coal mining town in British Columbia, ""socially responsive planning"" was an attempt to develop a town using principles derived from social science research. In this paper the reactions of residents to selected attributes which reflect the application of these principles are examined five years after settlement began. Ratings of community attributes offer an indication of aspects of residential satisfaction, while the results of a principal components analysis suggest the dimensionality of residents' evaluative structures and provide a useful framework within which to consider planning issues. Issues examined are: the association between employment and the community environment; the suitability of the environment for children; and the social environment. While social aspects of the new community are judged as satisfactory, less positive elements reflect the underlying influence of the economic well-being of the mining company on overall community satisfaction. When compared to indicators of community satisfaction in other western Canadian resource towns, ratings for Tumbler Ridge tend to be fairly low. It is concluded that the inability of planners to adequately control implementation or continuity of their ideas has resulted in a community not distinctly different from other resource towns. Efforts have been further hampered by a lack of adequate models of the distinctive dynamics of resource communities.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27520872,1991,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_27520872
0,The Abortion Decision: A Qualitative Choice Approach,"Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey, Youth Cohort, logistic regression models are estimated to show the impact of various sociodemographic and economic factors on the abortion decision for 1867 pregnancies occurring between 1983 and 1985 in the data set. The results suggest a profile of a woman choosing the abortion decision as being White, unmarried, residing in the Northeast or West, relatively well-educated, and either in-school or working. Additionally, the female is likely to have a relatively high person income and, if present, a relatively low spousal income. Being Baptist or Catholic appears to have no significant influence on the abortion decision, and the same is true for Baptists and Catholics who are religious (attend church more than two times per month). The degree of religiosity is a predictor of abortion outcome, irrespective of religious affiliation. Finally, it is found that for low income women, access to Medicaid funding does significantly increase the probability of choosing the abortion option.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27520968,1992,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_27520968
0,A Community Viability Indicator for Determining Comprehensive Planning Policy,"To assist in the development of planning policy for communities, a pilot test of a social viability indicator was conducted in a Baltimore City, Maryland Polish ethnic neighborhood in 1969 and 1981. The viability indicator, originally developed by Herbert Gans and modified for the purpose of this study, can be an important instrument for analyzing and developing public policy, and maintaining viable communities. The indiced revealed that the study area, which had slightly less sound physical residences than the city in general, had viable interdependent social relationships between the residences than the city in general, had viable interdependent social relationships between the residents. Twelve years later the area was restudied. The study area was still socially viable as originally predicted although physical structures evidence a slight increase in deterioration. The findings give evidence that neighbothood viability does not depend on a neighborhood's physical environment and thus substantiates Gans' hypothesis which had not been previously tested with a longitudinal study.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27521190,1984,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_27521190

0,The Social Context of Women's Labor Force Participation: A Comparative Analysis,"Utilizing data from 61 societies, this inquiry focuses on women's labor force participation as a characteristic of the social structure. First, the analysis demonstrates that participation is positively related to economic development and divorce rate and negatively related to fertility and income inequality. While the effect of economic development is mediated by various aspects of familial composition, the most significant effect on female labor force participation is that of income inequality. In societies where inequality is high, women are less likely to join the labor force. The analysis goes on to demonstrate that female labor force participation has consequences for occupational discrimination. The odds that women can achieve high status and well-paid occupations decrease with the proportion of women in the labor force. The findings reported here suggest strongly that the integration of females into the labor force is determined by the shape of the stratification system. Such integration, however, results in occupational discrimination. The meaning and significance of the findings are discussed in the light of sociological theories.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2778628,1980,American Journal of Sociology,10.2307_2778628
0,The Distribution of Power in Exchange Networks: Theory and Experimental Results,"This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the structural determinants of power in exchange networks, along with research findings from laboratory experiments and a computer simulation of bargaining in network structures. Two theoretical traditions are dealth with: (1) point centrality in graph-theoretic representations of structure, as an approach to power distributions; and (2) power dependence principles applied to exchange networks. Measures of centrality available in the literature have the advantage of being easily applied to large and complex networks. In contrast, power dependence concepts were conceived for use in microsociology and are found to be cumbersome in the analysis of complex networks. But despite the relative difficulty of applying power-dependence theory to network structures, that approach generates hypotheses about power distributions which are confirmed at nearly every point in a laboratory experiment with five-person networks and at every point in a computer simulation of networks too large for laboratory study. In contrast, centrality measures applied to the type of networks studied fail to predict power distributions. Although centrality measures might predict power in some networks, their generality is limited. Toward resolution of the issues raised, this study offers two theoretical points: (1) a distinction between two different principles of ""connection"" in social networks suggests that current measures of centrality might predict power in one type of network but not in the other; and (2) it offers a first step toward a fusion of power-dependence theory and structural centrality in a way which might be general across networks of both types.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2779142,1981,American Journal of Sociology,10.2307_2779142
0,"Social Theory, Social Research, and a Theory of Action","After an extraordinarily promising beginning in 1937 with The Structure of Social Action, Talcott Parsons abandoned his attempt to ground social theory in a theory of purposive action. The functionalism that resulted moved in one direction, while social research has progressively moved in an individual-behavioristic direction, resulting in an ever-widening divergence between research and theory. This paper describes paths in research and in theory development, that will reconstitute relevance of each for the other. The essential elements are two. The first is use of a theory of purposive action as a foundation for social theory; this entails acceptance of a form of methodological individualism and rejection of holism. The second is a focus in social research and theory on the movement from the level of individual actions to macrosocial functioning, that is, the level of system behavior.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2779798,1986,American Journal of Sociology,10.2307_2779798

In this paper, three models of the race of offender and victim are developed using aggregate national data on homicide (from the Uniform Crime Reports), rape, aggravated assault, simple assault, and robbery (from the National Crime Surveys.) Whatever measures are used, violent crimes are found to be intraracial to a far greater extent than statistically expected under these models.

The revised measures indicate that occupational segregation by sex remained quite constant from 1900 through 1970, although segregation in nonfarm occupations declined slowly.

Subjects sent more promises to the cooperative than to the competitive robot, and kept their promises more often when the robot reciprocated promises than when the robot used evasive replies.

First, a Japanese semantic differential dictionary of 403 fundamental identities and 307 fundamental behaviors provides evidence for culturally ideographic connotations. Second, a quasi-factorial design produces a Japanese set of impression-formation equations for predicting transient changes in identities and behaviors. The Japanese equations use a consistent subset of the American predictors with comparable weights, which suggests evidence for the cross-cultural similarity in cognitive processing of impression formation. Statistical tests of three of the four hypotheses are unable to reject the null hypothesis of no difference.

These predictions were tested in a two-party bargaining setting that allowed parties to exchange offers and counteroffers and to take punitive action against each other. The results generally support the implications of bilateral deterrence; parties facing opponents who took strong offensive measures used more punitive tactics than those who did not, whereas parties facing opponents who took strong retaliatory measures combined with weak offensive measures used fewer punitive tactics. Contrary to expectation, low-power actors did not differ from high-power actors in their use of offensive or defensive tactics.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2786952,1986,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_2786952
0,"Relative Ability, Paths of Relevance, and Influence in Task-Oriented Groups","In task-oriented groups, people accept influence more from others whom they believe, on the basis of diffuse and specific status characteristics as well as prior performances, to have greater ability at the task. Past research has treated difference in ability as a binary variabel (better or worse); it is not known whether magnitude of difference in performances translated into relative magnitude of inferred ability, and thence into degrees of differentiation in the status structure of decision-making groups. We conducted an experiment to examine the relative impact of three aspects of task performance on the inference of ability: absolute level of performance, relative performance (better/worse), and the degree of difference in performances by two group members. These variables then were used to predict acceptance of influence in a two-person decision task. Simple binary difference in ability explained 35 per cent of the variance in influence accepted. Degree of difference in ability significantly increased level of prediction, particularly for subjects in the lower range of performance scores, thus supporting the claim that relative and absolute levels of performance create additional differences in expectations. Finally, we propose that a concept of ""graded status characteristics"" should be incorporated into status characteristics theory.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2787048,1996,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_2787048
0,"Density, Transitivity, and Diffuse Status in Task-Oriented Groups","Small-group researchers recently have been concerned with how diffuse status characteristics such as race and gender combine with verbal and nonverbal cues to structure relations in task groups. In this paper we investigate the structure of precedence relations in such groups, including whether these relations are dense, whether they are transitive, and whether they are structured in any obvious way by diffuse status characteristics. Using transcript data on six-person mixed-gender discussion groups, we found relational density in about 55 percent of the dyads, transitivity in about 75 percent of the completed triads, and no clear pattern by gender. Each of these findings is contrary to assumptions contained in a formal participation model by Fisek, Berger, and Norman for which these authors reported strong empirical support. To investigate this apparent contradiction, we designed and carried out Monte Carlo simulations, creating simulated data with a known underlying structure, and applying Fisek et al.'s research methodology to our simulated evidence. Although the simulated data, by design, systematically violate Fisek et al.'s density and diffuse status assumptions, their model actually fits these data better than it fits the empirical Smith-Lovin data. We discuss both theoretical and methodological implications of our empirical and Monte Carlo results.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2787126,1995,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_2787126

0,Differences in Work Hours and Hours Preferences by Race in the U.S.,"Significant differences exist in actual and preferred work hours by race. Specifically, black males work 20 percent fewer annual hours than white males. The differences between black and white women are small. Black workers are significantly more likely than white workers to prefer additional work and fewer are satisfied with their current hours of work. I use the hours-inequality hypothesis of Bell and Freeman (1995, 1997) to evaluate the extent to which race differences in work hours and hours preferences are related to race differences in incentives. I demonstrate that whereas white workers work longer hours in response to overall wage variation in their relevant labor market cell, black workers react to the wage variation among black workers but not to the variation overall. The fact that labor market incentives are different for otherwise similar black and white workers is difficult to reconcile with standard competitive theory.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/29769977,1998,Review of Social Economy,10.2307_29769977
0,The Significance of the Monetary Context of Economic Behavior,"The dominant paradigm in economics views economic behavior as allocative activity in a neutral, C-M-C′ economy. As a consequence, money is treated as a veil that is inessential to the real functioning of the economic system. This paper argues that one of Keynes's fundamental insights is the significance of the monetary context of economic behavior. This insight has been developed by the post-Keynesian theory of money as a ""time-machine vehicle"" that provides the causal link between uncertainty and unemployment. The Circuitist theory of money as the means of final payment provides a complementary radical perspective on the significance of the monetary context. This paper investigates the methodological and theoretical implications of these radical monetary theories and assesses their contribution towards the development of a general theory of a monetary production, M-C-M′ economy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/29770155,2002,Review of Social Economy,10.2307_29770155

This review discusses the emerging research on day labor, paying particular attention to the practice of day labor, including the market's origins, its contemporary development, and its hiring and wage practices. The review also provides a synopsis of informal, open-air and formal temp agency day labor practices, their spatial and organizational configurations, and an outline of the legal issues and public policies that structure, to a large degree, worker and employer relations in this industry.

The findings show significant changes in returns to education and in the rise of private/hybrid firms in the reform era. There is also strong evidence of institutional persistence in returns to positional power and in the organizational hierarchy.

0,Social Isolation in America: Changes in Core Discussion Networks over Two Decades,"Have the core discussion networks of Americans changed in the past two decades? In 1985, the General Social Survey (GSS) collected the first nationally representative data on the confidants with whom Americans discuss important matters. In the 2004 GSS the authors replicated those questions to assess social change in core network structures. Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in 1985. The number of people saying there is no one with whom they discuss important matters nearly tripled. The mean network size decreases by about a third (one confidant), from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004. The modal respondent now reports having no confidant; the modal respondent in 1985 had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of non-kin ties leads to more confidant networks centered on spouses and parents, with fewer contacts through voluntary associations and neighborhoods. Most people have densely interconnected confidants similar to them. Some changes reflect the changing demographics of the U.S. population. Educational heterogeneity of social ties has decreased, racial heterogeneity has increased. The data may overestimate the number of social isolates, but these shrinking networks reflect an important social change in America.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/30038995,2006,American Sociological Review,10.2307_30038995
0,Gender Differences in Competition and Dominance During Married-Couples Group Therapy,"Previous research on same-sex interaction has documented competitive patterns for males, but not for females. By contrast, some studies characterize cross-sex interaction as competitive; other studies, as noncompetitive. To extend research on the processes of competition and dominance in same-and cross-sex interaction, the present study examines verbal interaction sequences that occurred during two brief psychotherapy groups conducted for the same set of five married couples. All interaction sequences have been classified according to the Ericson-Rogers Relational Coding System, and patterns analyzed by means of a log-linear statistical procedure. For same-sex interaction, findings document more indiscriminant competition between males than between females. These results extend previous findings. For cross-sex interaction, a complex pattern of competition and dominance is observed. Although females compete with males under certain conditions, males do not compete with females. However, males apparently interrupt females freely, thus suggesting that males assume a dominant position. Females tend to ""interrupt back,"" an indication that male dominance is not acceptable. However, females are also more submissive toward husbands than toward other males. The question remains whether these patterns are applicable to a more general population.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3033831,1981,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_3033831

German psychoanalyst and sociologist Erich Fromm's work provides a useful theoretical microfoundation for contemporary work on nationalism, the politics of identity, and the roots of war and violence. Fromm's analysis of Nasism in Escape from Freedom (1941), in particular, outlines a compelling theory of irrationality, and his later writings on nationalism provide an existential psychoanalysis that can be useful for contemporary social theory and sociology of emotions. Escape from Freedom synthesizes Marxist, Freudian, Weberian, and existentialist insights to offer an Original theoretical explanation of Nazism that combines both Macrostructural and micropsychological levels of analysis.

Our framework for research on taxpaying emphasizes that compliance is as problematic as noncompliance, that individuals have different opportunities for both compliance and noncompliance, and that taxpaying does not necessarily involve deliberate decisions. Both the process of decision making and the content of decisions must be studied. Four clusters of factors affecting the content of compliance decisions are material consequences, normative expectations, sociolegal attitudes and beliefs, and expressive factors. How individuals subjectively ""frame"" the factors depends upon their social situations.

0,The Impact of Research on Legal Policy: The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment,"Experimental research has recently shown a powerful impact on legal policy. An experiment demonstrating a deterrent effect of arrest on domestic violence has shaped public policy. Stimulated by efforts to publicize the results of the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment (Sherman and Berk, 1984a), police departments were persuaded to adopt an arrest policy for misdemeanor domestic violence. Over one-third of respondents from U.S. police departments in 117 cities said their policy had been influenced by the experiment, although respondents from some departments that adopted an arrest policy did not recognize the experiment or its results. Lempert (1987, 1984), citing medical research as precedent, suggests that this impact is premature and inappropriate until replications are completed. However, we find no indication that medical research employs a standard of delaying adoption of research results prior to replication. Our analysis suggests that publicity can encourage replication of legal research at other sites and thus improve the knowledge base for policy recommendations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3053883,1977,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3053883
0,Discrepancies between the Legal Code and Community Standards for Sex and Violence: An Empirical Challenge to Traditional Assumptions in Obscenity Law,"Community standards for sexually explicit and violent depictions were measured using a representative sample of Western Tennessee residents. The residents were randomly assigned to view sexually explicit films charged in an obscenity case, violent materials, or control materials. The results showed that residents believe the sexually explicit films charged in the case did not appeal to a self-reported shameful, morbid, or unhealthy (prurient) interest in sex, and are not patently offensive. Community members indicated they would be substantially less accepting of the sexually explicit materials if they contained rape and bondage, and they showed virtually no acceptance of materials including children actors under the age of 18. Despite acceptance of sexually explicit films, there was no evidence that a majority of members of the community accepted violent ""slasher"" films. However, participants believed that the majority of others in the community tolerated the violent films they had viewed. These findings are discussed in light of an obscenity standard that presumes to take into account conventional morality and community opinion and the discrepancy between the obscenity code and community standards.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3054056,1995,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3054056
0,The Structure of Disadvantage: Individual and Occupational Determinants of the Black-White Wage Gap,"This study is motivated by the idea that the racial gap in earnings is generated not only by individual differences but also by systematic variation in the occupational structure that attenuates or exacerbates the effects of race. Using data from the 1990 census and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, a hierarchical linear modeling approach is employed that allows the simultaneous exploration of the mechanisms of income inequality operating both within and between occupations. Among private-sector employees, striking evidence shows that racial disparities increase in both absolute and percentage terms as one moves up the occupational earnings hierarchy. The association between average occupational earnings and within-occupation racial disadvantage reveals an overlooked source of racial earnings inequality which constrains the opportunities available to upwardly mobile black men in the private sector. This association cannot be explained by measured individual characteristics, or by the status, demographic composition, or skill demands of occupations. In the public sector, on the other hand, racial inequality in earnings is not systematically associated with average occupational earnings, and is instead more closely tied to individual human capital and occupational placement. The implications of these results are considered and directions for future research are suggested.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3088922,2001,American Sociological Review,10.2307_3088922
0,Clarifying the Theory of Second-Order Expectations: The Correspondence between Motives for Interaction and Actors' Orientation toward Group Interaction,"Using recent developments on ""second-order expectations"" from status characteristics theory, we examine how the weighting of three motives (task performance, avoidance of status loss, and facilitation of interaction) affects an actor's orientation toward task performance and other group members, as well as an actor's behavior towards others. We propose that a differential weighting of these motives affects the extent to which actors in the same status position behave assertively in a group. We also argue that the scope conditions of status characteristics theory (i.e., task orientation and collective orientation) may correspond to a situation in which the three motives are explicitly weighted equally. Results from our experiment support our arguments. This research clarifies (1) earlier theorizing and research on the relation between first- and second-order expectations and (2) how the scope conditions of task and collective orientation relate to an actor's motivations in problem-solving groups.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3090129,1999,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_3090129
0,Navajo Women and the Politics of Identity,"This article examines intergenerational changes in the construction and reconstruction of Indian identity, and links those changes to changes in social, political, economic, and cultural contexts. Interviews with Navajo women revealed distinct patterns in their self-identification as Navajo and as Indian. Women who were born prior to the self-determination movements of the 1960s and who grew up in the context of Navajo communities distanced themselves from, and actively disrupted, negative and Stereotypic representations of Indians, drawing on their specific tribal identities to do so. Women born after 1960 were less likely to distance themselves from Indian identity, but also reframed the meanings associated with that identity. These results illustrate the importance of womens strategies for cultural survival and their use of resources that are historically and socially patterned in the process of constructing distinct and positive identities as Indian and as Navajo. The point is that you know your language and your culture. That makes you a person. That makes you have an identity. Thats what you can fall back on. Lena, age 17, 1991 The past continues to speak to us. But it no longer addresses us as a simple, factual 'past.' It is always constructed through memory, fantasy, narrative and myth. Cultural identities are the points of identification, the unstable points of identification or suture, which are made within the discourses of history and culture. Not an essence, but a positioning. Hence, there is always a politics of identity, a politics of position, which has no absolute guarantee in an unproblematic, transcendental 'law of origin.'

0,The Statistical Evaluation of Social Network Dynamics,"A class of statistical models is proposed for longitudinal network data. The dependent variable is the changing (or evolving) relation network, represented by two or more observations of a directed graph with a fixed set of actors. The network evolution is modeled as the consequence of the actors making new choices, or withdrawing existing choices, on the basis of functions, with fixed and random components, that the actors try to maximize. Individual and dyadic exogenous variables can be used as covariates. The change in the network is modeled as the stochastic result of network effects (reciprocity, transitivity, etc.) and these covariates. The existing network structure is a dynamic constraint for the evolution of the structure itself. The models are continuous-time Markov chain models that can be implemented as simulation models. The model parameters are estimated from observed data. For estimating and testing these models, statistical procedures are proposed that are based on the method of moments. The statistical procedures are implemented using a stochastic approximation algorithm based on computer simulations of the network evolution process.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3097281,1994,Sociological Methodology,10.2307_3097281

0,Epistemological Culture Theory: A Micro Theory of the Origin and Maintenance of Culture,"This paper presents a new ""epistemological"" theory of culture that explains how individuals enhance their sense of security in the world by creating and maintaining culture as knowledge of the world. Using cognitive and affective processes previously ignored by culture theorists, the theory posits three dimensions of cultural production: we articulate, typify, and orient our experiences to make them meaningful. The theory asserts that we produce culture because it allows us to feel as if we understand our world, and to perceive it as ordered; this in turn triggers an aesthetic response of knowledge-based affect. The theory explains how cultural production is motivated by the pursuit of meaningfulness as well as material interests. The theory describes how an oppressive culture can be reproduced unintentionally, even by the groups it oppresses. The theory also identifies connections between social structure and culture where conditions of ambiguity or control have implications for how meaning can be created.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108646,1981,Sociological Theory,10.2307_3108646
0,Risking Relationships: Understanding the Litigation Choices of Sexually Harassed Women,"Resource mobilization and gender socialization theories go a long way toward explaining why so many sexually harassed women opt not to report their problems, but they shed little light on why some still choose to take action and sue. This article examines how relationality can affect a sexually harassed woman's decision to sue. An analysis of 31 litigation narratives shows that regardless of the severity of the harassment, or the amount of legal aid available, maternal responsibilities, marital commitments and parental approval can become pivotal considerations. Some considered the integrity of familial ties to be priceless assets worth suing for. Others deemed them too valuable to risk losing in a contest over rights. These narratives confirm feminist assertions that relationships-especially familial ones-often play a central role in the choices that women make. They also challenge popular assumptions about what constitutes a ""personal choice"" and under what circumstances women are likely to chose to litigate.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3115096,1987,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3115096
0,Neighborhood-Based Models for Social Networks,"We argue that social networks can be modeled as the outcome of processes that occur in overlapping local regions of the network, termed local social neighborhoods. Each neighborhood is conceived as a possible site of interaction and corresponds to a subset of possible network ties. In this paper, we discuss hypotheses about the form of these neighborhoods, and we present two new and theoretically plausible ways in which neighborhood-based models for networks can be constructed. In the first, we introduce the notion of a setting structure, a directly hypothesized (or observed) set of exogenous constraints on possible neighborhood forms. In the second, we propose higher-order neighborhoods that are generated, in part, by the outcome of interactive network processes themselves. Applications of both approaches to model construction are presented, and the developments are considered within a general conceptual framework of locale for social networks. We show how assumptions about neighborhoods can be cast within a hierarchy of increasingly complex models; these models represent a progressively greater capacity for network processes to ""reach"" across a network through long cycles or semipaths. We argue that this class of models holds new promise for the development of empirically plausible models for networks and network-based processes.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3186162,1993,Sociological Methodology,10.2307_3186162
0,Talking about Sex: Notes on First Coitus and the Double Sexual Standard,"Building upon the sexual socialization ideas of Gagnon and Simon and others which have stressed male-female differences in premarital sexual behavior, the social and psychological management of the first coital experience is examined. Using data from a 1967 national sample of university undergraduates, the idea of a double standard is explicated in terms of reportage about first coitus-to whom the person reports the event, how many people, how soon, and the like. Evidence pointing to a pattern of male ""ego-sex"" emerges within the context of the so-called ""male bond"" (male peers as audiences for sexual prowess), which contrasts sharply with the modal females's management of first coitus. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of future trends in gender styles and premarital sexuality.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/350881,1971,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_350881
0,Marital Homogamy the Second Time around," Recent declines in the marriage rate and increases in the prevalence of remarriage point to the need for more careful analysis of the nature of second marriage. Very few sound empirical data are available concerning the mate selection or adjustment processes of second marriages, and this hampers the development of useful, generalized knowledge about remarriage. Utilizing data from the 1970 National Fertility Survey, this paper compares the levels of marital homogamy—in age, education and religious identification—of women in their first marriages and women in their second marriages, as well as in the previous marriages of the twice-wed women. The analysis shows that twice-wed women experience low homogamy in both their current and first marriages. The persistence of this pattern through the application of controls for status, age, and religiosity indicates that the differences do not result primarily from marriage market constraints. Though several caveats are noted, the results support the perspective that some women, either because of their conception of marriage, or because of their mate selection pattern, are disproportionately prone to divorce and remarry. The implications of these findings for divorce trends are discussed. ",https://www.jstor.org/stable/350936,1975,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_350936

As expected, the voluntarily childless women, whether married or single, rated the costs of a child higher and the satisfactions lower than did all other women. While married early deciders and married postponers among voluntarily childless wives had similar perceptions of the disadvantages in having a child, wives childless through postponement were more like mothers in their attitudes about the psychological benefits gained in having a child and their attitudes to outside employment. Single women wanting to be childless were more like married early deciders in their perceptions than married postponers. Mothers of one child by choice were not as similar to the voluntarily childless as expected. Mothers of one child by choice revealed childrearing attitudes that showed them to be most different from the voluntarily childless in their perceptions of the costs in having a child, but as more likely than two-child mothers to stress emotional satisfactions, personal development benefits, and gains to the marital relationship in having a child.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/352393,1980,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_352393

0,"Bringing Home the Bacon: Marital Allocation of Income-Earning Responsibility, Job Shifts, and Men's Wages","Studies show that married men earn more than single men, even when human capital is controlled. There has been little effort to integrate the study of the marriage effect on men's wages with the literature on the division of labor in the household or to understand behavioral processes that link marital status to men's wages. This study addresses both oversights. Three dominant perspectives on the allocation of household responsibilities suggest that married couples are likely to assign more income-earning responsibility to the husband. These perspectives can be extended to predict that married men set higher earnings goals than single men. Married men are likely to be more attentive to opportunities to increase their earnings and to risks that could reduce their earnings. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this study focuses on men's job-shift processes. Findings indicate that married men are more likely than single men to pursue job-shift patterns that result in greater wage gains and to avoid those that result in lower wage gains and that a portion of the marriage differential in men's wages is attributable to job-shift processes.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/353887,1999,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_353887
0,"Power, Identity, and Collective Action in Social Exchange","Our research aims to bring collective action back into the study of structural determinants of power in social exchange. Previous research has focused primarily on the bargaining power of actors whose locations in exchange networks confer different risks of exclusion. We argue that structural position affects not only bargaining power but also the ability of low-power actors to organize against unequal bargaining power. We hypothesize that collective action among low-power actors is facilitated by identification with others who are structurally disadvantaged. We test two identity-theoretic expected utility models that specify how actors in a mixed-motive coalition game might take into account the payoffs to others in structurally equivalent positions. In the utilitarian model, actors maximize the greatest good to the greatest number. In the collectivist model, actors also seek to minimize in-group inequality. Results show some support for the utilitarian model among female participants and strong support for the collectivist model among both males and females. We speculate about causes of gender differences and identify directions for future exchange-theoretic research on social identity and socially embedded collective action.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3598440,1997,Social Forces,10.2307_3598440
0,Is Family Cohesion a Risk or Protective Factor during Adolescent Development?,"This study investigated linear aspects of family cohesion using a cohort sequential design. Adolescents (N = 4,677) were surveyed and followed in three cohorts from 6th to 10th grade. Family cohesion was measured using the cohesion subscale of the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scales. Latent Growth Curve Modeling procedures were conducted to explore whether family cohesion decreased, increased, or remained stable from early to middle adolescence. Results show a linear trajectory with statistically significant decreases in family cohesion from 6th through 10th grades. The findings support the linear nature of the trajectories but the decrease in levels may not be substantive because of the large sample size.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3599933,1988,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_3599933

The three biases, or ""theoretical barriers,"" are the identification of evangelicalism with social class, political, and historical correlates. The paper argues against the assumption that evangelicalism is in essence the religion of the disinherited, the conservative, or the atavistic, especially if we are to understand the resurgence of evangelicalism in mainline and middle-class churches.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3710492,1976,Sociological Analysis,10.2307_3710492
0,Family Structure History and Adolescent Romance,"This study examined the association between family structure history and adolescent romance. Using a national sample drawn from Add Health (N = 13,570), family structure at Wave I was associated with the likelihood that adolescents were involved in a romantic relationship at Wave II and, among those in a relationship, the number of relationships they had since Wave I. Cumulative family instability and its timing were also associated with these outcomes and largely drove the family structure effects. Gender and age interactions suggest that experiences of family instability were more consequential to the romantic lives of boys and younger teens.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40056361,2008,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_40056361
0,Infighting and Ideology: How Conflict Informs the Local Culture of the Chicago Dyke March,"Although the study of local cultures has become established in American sociology, it often ignores the contested nature of how culture emerges and is negotiated within the context of small groups. To this end, we address the concept of infighting, a subtype of conflict, as it operates within a small group framework. Building on an ethnographic study of the Chicago Dyke March, we demonstrate that infighting highlights competing ideologies that may remain implicit in the absence of such conflict. Infighting treats divergent meaning systems as part of local contention between rival cliques and power centers. These ideological battles both reflect pre-existing differences between subgroups and serve to make explicit and public such differences, both in their background characteristics and in their interests. In the process infighting directs attention away from shared concerns and group building to questions of strategy, transforming the small group into an arena of ideological production and factional rivalry. Infighting recasts a group from a space of consensus to a contested political arena. We elaborate four analytic processes through which infighting connects to ideology and small group culture: infighting emphasizes the multivocality of meaning, cultural heterogeneity, an equilibrium of inclusion and group boundaries, and planning in light of ideologies of power.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40206147,2008,"International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society",10.2307_40206147

This article attempts to bypass this dichotomy by examining how emotion and rationality are conjoined in the practice of the choice of a mate. We posit the fundamental role of culture in determining the nature of this intertwinement. We explore the culturally embedded intertwining of emotion and rationality through the notion oí modal configuration. Modal configuration includes five key features: reflexivity, techniques, modal emphasis, modal overlap, and modal sequencing. We apply this framework to the topic of partner selection. Comparing primary and secondary sources on pre-modern partner selection and on internet dating, we show that emotion and rationality were intertwined in both periods but that what differs between them is precisely the emotion-rationality modality.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40345661,2009,Theory and Society,10.2307_40345661
0,Mass Media and Religious Identity: A Case Study of Young Witches,"Drawing on interviews with 90 young people who have become Witches, we explore the visual media's influence on identity formation and maintenance. Witchcraft is a late modern religion that is highly individualistic and many young people report they have become a Witch without any interaction with other Witches. The rapid growth of interest in this religion among the young since The Craft was first shown provides an important example of the mass media's role in formation of contemporary religious identity. We argue that representations of Witchcraft in the visual mass media (along with other cultural trends such as environmentalism, feminism, and individualism) and cultural resources such as books, Internet sites, and magazines provide a mediated form of social interaction that sustains the plausibility of Witchcraft as a religion. It also helps the young to develop and legitimate their beliefs and practices and develop their Witchcraft persona.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40405642,2009,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_40405642
0,Social Development in Hong Kong: Development Issues Identified by Social Development Index (SDI),"Surviving the aftermaths of the Asian Financial Crisis and SARS in 2003, Hong Kong's economy has re-gained its momentum and its economic growth has been quite remarkable too in recent few years. Nevertheless, as reflected by the Social Development Index (SDI), economic growth in Hong Kong does not seem to have benefited the people of the city at large as we see social qualities such as cohesion, security, equity, and empowerment are gradually eroded. This paper aims to summarize the current state of social development in Hong Kong based on the SDI-2008 and identify the major social, political and economic challenges that are confronted by Hong Kong. Based on the findings, a range of policy options proposed for promoting a more balanced approach to social and economic development are discussed.

0,"Class, Culture, and Participation in the Collegiate Extra-Curriculum","With larger percentages of high school students entering higher education, it becomes increasingly important to look at how processes occurring on college campuses contribute to social stratification. Using in-depth interviews with 61 students, I ask: How does social class structure students' participation in the collegiate extra-curriculum? I argue that the collegiate extra-curriculum is an important site for stratification because it is there that students gain access to social and cultural resources valued by the privileged classes. I find that upper-middle-class students arrive on campus with cultural resources that motivate their participation and social resources that facilitate their involvement. Among working-class students, limited financial factors constrain their involvement, while social and cultural resources further curtail their interest in such activities. These findings contribute to theories of social and cultural reproduction by showing that those who have more valued social and cultural resources at the outset are in a better position to gain additional such resources throughout their college careers. Moreover, these analyses show that symbolic and cultural hierarchies are sustained by the interdependent relationship between social and cultural capital.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40542600,2009,Sociological Forum,10.2307_40542600
0,The Polish Solidarity Movement in Retrospect: In Search of a Mnemonic Mirror,"The legacy of the Solidarity movement of the 1980s, which was a leading force in the region's 1989 revolutions, culminating most symbolically with the fall of the Berlin Wall, has yet to be institutionalized in Polish social memory. A spate of official commemorations marking the movement's 25th anniversary in 2005 provided a palette on which Poles projected—or refused to project—their memories. The movement's legacy continues to play out in current and contentious electoral politics, since the leaders of the top contending parties are former Solidarity activists. Despite and partly because of this active presence of Solidarity movement players, Polish civil society appears to be in a liminal state of active hesitation over the task of concretizing this movement's past in commemorative forms. This article proposes six cultural and political explanations for this hesitation. It also recommends that social scientists disaggregate the concept of memory work into various manifestations on a continuum from hesitation to deliberation and agitation to institutionalization. As the article illustrates, hesitation can constitute action. At stake in this exercise is a larger discourse— over the direction of the post-1989 sociopolitical changes vis-a-vis the aims of the 1989 revolutions and the meaning of democracy and transitional justice in a posttotalitarian context.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40608223,2009,"International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society",10.2307_40608223
0,"Listening to Rap: Cultures of Crime, Cultures of Resistance","This research compares representations of rap music with the self-reported criminal behavior and resistant attitudes of the music's core audience. Our database is a large sample of Toronto high school students (n = 3,393) from which we identify a group of listeners, whose combination of musical likes and dislikes distinguish them as rap univores. We then examine the relationship between their cultural preference for rap music and involvement in a culture of crime and their perceptions of social injustice and inequity. We find that the rap univores, also known as urban music enthusiasts, report significantly more delinquent behavior and stronger feelings of inequity and injustice than listeners with other musical tastes. However, we also find that the nature and strengths of those relationships vary according to the racial identity of different groups within urban music enthusiasts. Black and white subgroups align themselves with resistance representations while Asians do not; whites and Asians report significant involvement in crime and delinquency, while blacks do not. Finally, we discuss our findings in light of research on media effects and audience reception, youth subcultures and post-subcultural analysis, and the sociology of cultural consumption.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40645821,2009,Social Forces,10.2307_40645821
0,The Impact of Origin and Host Country Schooling on the Economic Performance of Immigrants,"This study examines the economic returns to schooling acquired in the country of origin and the country of destination. It uses large-scale survey data on Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Antillean immigrants in the Netherlands, which contain direct measures of pre-and post-migration schooling. It is studied whether the returns to origin-country schooling depend on contextual factors: i.e., immigrant group and the region of living. Furthermore, we examine the importance of host-country schooling for labor market outcomes and if these can be partly explained by increasing contacts with natives. Results show that the returns to origin-country schooling are higher for Surinamese and Antillean immigrants (i.e., those originating from former Dutch colonies) than for immigrants from Turkey and Morocco. The returns to origin-country schooling are not affected by ethnic concentration in the region of living. Finally, it appears that the returns to host-country schooling are much larger than to origin-country schooling, and the higher returns to host-country schooling cannot be explained by increased social contacts with natives.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40645827,2009,Social Forces,10.2307_40645827

In terms of the representation of mothers, three findings stand out. First, the images presented are consistent between magazines in terms of the layout of the ads, the figures presented, the physical attributes of mothers, and suggested maternal roles. Second, the portrayal of motherhood over time is nonlinear and can be divided into distinct phases by decade. These phases highlight an ideological shift in the presentation of motherhood from domestically centered to childcentered expertise. Third, the advertised products presented in each phase vary significantly. I link these shifts to shifts in consumption patterns and examine the processes by which ""intensive mothering"" emerged as a central focus and force in modern consumer culture.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41035601,2005,Berkeley Journal of Sociology,10.2307_41035601
0,Friendship Patterns and Upward Mobility: A Test of Social Capital Hypothesis,"In this paper, we argue that having a large number of non-redundant friends—that is, friends who do not know each other—is conducive to upward mobility. We define friendship patterns using two quantities: the number of all friends and the density of ties among friends. Applying a job-mobility model, based on the utility anticipated from a possible new job, we test the hypothesis that social capital in the form of sparse networks, also known as networks with structural holes, positively stimulates upward mobility—above and beyond social characteristics traditionally used in status attainment research. On the basis of survey data gathered in Poland, we test social capital hypotheses pertaining to change in earnings during a five-year period, 1998-2003. Our results indicate that non-redundant ties among friends influence income attainment. In addition, we find that fifteen years after the collapse of communism, having friends who were members of the communist party is an inhibitor of upward mobility, while having friends who were entrepreneurs increases people's chances of establishing their own businesses, independently of the number of potential bridges between friends.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41274928,2005,Polish Sociological Review,10.2307_41274928
0,Foucault Reads Freud: The Dialogue with Unreason and Enlightenment,"The title of the essay refers to the famous statement in Foucaults introduction to his History of Madness where he writes that ""we have to do justice to Freud"". The problem, however, is that Foucault's philosophy does not seem to do justice to Freud. Foucault's use of Freud is ambiguous: sometimes he uses him for purely instrumental purposes (when reconstructing the history of madness and sexuality), but sometimes—for anthropological purposes signaling Freud's role in redefining our common humanity and particularly our relation to language, life and work. The author confronts Foucault's ambiguous reading of Freud with the equally ambiguous reading of Foucault by Derrida. Derrida discusses Foucault twice. Once in the essay Cogito and The History of Madness in which Derrida takes on Foucault's understanding of Descartes and his role in the exclusion of madness from the realm of reason. The second time—in his essay To Do Justice to Freud. Here Derrida disagrees with Foucault whether Freud managed to reestablish the body's communication with reason which Descartes destroyed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41275157,2010,Polish Sociological Review,10.2307_41275157

After coming to the study of religion slowly in comparison with other social science disciplines, political science finally has a theoretically diverse and thriving religion and politics subfield. However, political scientists' contributions to the social scientific study of religion are hampered by a lack of agreement about whether endogenous or exogenous theoretical approaches ought to dominate our scholarship. I assert that the concept of culture — and more specifically, subculture — might help create more connections across theoretical research traditions. I emphasize how the concept of religion-based subculture is inherent in psychological, social psychological, social movement, and contextual approaches to religion and politics scholarship, and I explore these theoretical connections using the example of religion-based ""us versus them"" discourses in contemporary American politics.",external-fulltext-any,2011,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_41349945
0,SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS RELATING TO FERTILITY: A GHANAIAN LEVEL TEST OF THE CONTEXTUAL THEORY OF FERTILITY,"This paper analyzed the direct and indirect relationships between socioeconomic characteristics of Ghanaian women and their fertility. The characteristics considered in the direct relationships were education, occupation and place of residence. The indirect relationship was considered by adjusting for household assets and the following proximate variable: postpartum abstinence, duration of breastfeeding, contraceptive use, and infant/child mortality. The Ghana Demographic and Health Survey data (GDHS) of 1993 were used and a sample of 2560 married women was selected for analysis. The results of mult iv ari at e analysis show that cumulative fertility, as measured by deviation from the average marital cohort fertility, varies significantly by education, occupation and place of residence. When household assets, postpartum abstinence, breastfeeding, contraceptive use, and infant/child mortality were controlled for, fertility varies significantly by female education, male modern sector jobs, and urban place of residence. Apart from contraceptive use, all the proximate variables are significant predictors of fertility. The findings suggest that socioeconomic factors influence fertility through abstinence, breastfeeding, and infant/child mortality.

We included 825 participants (20–90 years). Q1SF-36, using words or images, was included in a global questionnaire interview and at the end participants filled the SF-36. The agreement was tested by weighted kappa coefficients (WKappa). Classification Trees were used in the calibration of Q1SF-36 responses, with the physical (PDSF36) and mental dimensions of SF-36. Polyserial correlation coefficients and areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were used for validation. After categorization, using PDSF36 classification trees, the WKappa were 0.770 (self-administered vs. interviewer), 0.569 (self-administered vs. facial-expressions) and 0.566 (interviewer vs. facial-expressions). The WKappa between the PDSF36 and the modes (self-administered, interviewer and facial-expressions) were 0.784, 0.713 and 0.579 and the corresponding polyserial correlation coefficients were 0.784, 0.713 and 0.579.

0,SYSTEM VERSUS INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS: A CROSS-NATIONAL STUDY OF AGRICULTURAL INNOVATIVENESS,"Data collected from a total of 1,822 farm operators in eight Indian (N= 680) and eighteen Nigerian (N= 1,142) villages were analyzed both at the individual and social system levels to provide a crossnational comparison of individual and system effects on the innovativeness of individual members of a system. Three major objectives of this analysis were : (1) to ascertain the degree to which individual and system variables affect the innovativeness of individual members of a system, (2) to determine the extent to which system variables and individual variables each contribute (independently of the other) to explaining individual innovativeness, and (3) to account for the joint contribution of individual and system variables (by considering them systematically and simultaneously) in explaining individual innovativeness. Data relating to these three objectives were assessed using a series of zero-order, partial, and multiple correlations, respectively. In most cases, our analysis produced significant correlations (p<.05) of the eight individual and system variables with innovativeness in both countries. While in India, the system measures of some variables were better predictors than4heir individual measures, the reverse was true in Nigeria. Results indicated that in addition to system effects and individual effects, system variables and individual variables contributed (independently of the other) to explaining innovativeness. In both countries, all but one of the eight correlations for the individual variables were significant (p<.05) when effects of the corresponding system variables were partialled out. Similarly, by partialing out the effects of individual variables, the correlations of all but one of the eight system variables retained significance (p<.05) in India, but did not for most of system variables in Nigeria, These results suggested that system effects, while present, were not as strong for Nigerian farmers as for Indian farmers.

This article puts forward a constructivist argument, which understands religion as a dynamic of personal and group identification, as the key to illuminating its social significance. Drawing on analysis of in-depth interviews it finds four main ways in which religion informs processes of social identification and community construction in Northern Ireland: where it acts as an identity marker; where religious rituals play a practical role, or religious ideas play a symbolic role, in the construction of community; and, where doctrine can legitimize oppositional social identifications. In fact, specifically religious structures and religious ideas remain socially significant beyond the confines of the most devout. Thus, rather than just marking out ethnic identities, this article argues that religion generally provides some substantive content to processes of categorization and social comparison in Northern Ireland.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4153113,1973,Sociology of Religion,10.2307_4153113

Using census data and multivariate logistic analyses, we examine gender differences in labor force participation, occupational status and income in eight ethnic-generational class groups in Israel: Israeli-born Jews, first-and second-generation Western Jews, first-and secondgeneration Eastern Jews, Moslems, Christians, and Druse. Almquist's hypothesis is not supported by our data. We argue that gender inequalities are better explained by the structural advantage of men from the dominant group who control the allocation of resources for all groups. This advantage is augmented by economic development and differential opportunities for the accumulation of wealth. It is tempered by the protection provided by ethnic labor market enclaves.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41675024,2002,"Race, Gender & Class",10.2307_41675024

0,Extreme Asceticism: Confucian Practice and Riesebrodt's Religious Virtuoso,"The ascetic ideals initially established by Confucius are moderate and rational. Yet, virtuoso asceticism became a social phenomenon when the state desired to institute a more powerful channel to disseminate Confucian values in the broader populace beyond the literati. The reason that the cult of the virtuoso particularly served this purpose was that the enshrinement of virtuoso generated social power within community. That social power, somewhat equivalent to charisma, derived from the enshrined spirit's connection with transcendence having official and public offerings from community. The social process in the formation of the ascetic virtuoso and its social function in the Confucian tradition follow a pattern similar to that laid out by Martin Riesebrodt: denial of the physical self restructuring of social relations, and spiritual transformation. Ascetic virtuosos stemming from the tradition of ""inner-worldly"" asceticism closed a gap between a rationalized system of behavior-regulating practices and interventionist practice with reference to transcendence.",external-fulltext-any,2012,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_41681805

This essay elaborates on the guiding principles of that law, examines its basis in light of Ciceronian versus descriptive economics, considers its ramifications for socio-political institutions and economic reform, and addresses the question of social versus economic justice. The recognition of the power of economic rent in the distribution of income and wealth has once again made George's philosophy of economics a guide for reforms in public finance, the alleviation of poverty, and the long-term stewardship of the environment.",external-fulltext-any,2012,American Journal of Economics and Sociology,10.2307_41721424
0,Natural Law and the Roman Catholic Tradition: The Importance of Philosophical Realism,"The intellectual tradition of Roman Catholicism considers natural-law theory as providing the philosophical machinery for articulating concepts central to thinking about moral theory, legal theory, and the social order. The thrust of this essay is to explicate the positions rooted in the writings of Aquinas on natural-law theory, a theory with which a Georgist might find some stimulating similarities. Conditions necessary for natural-law moral and legal theory are considered through an analysis of the central metaphysical concepts together with their historical development and contemporary significance.",external-fulltext-any,2012,American Journal of Economics and Sociology,10.2307_41721425
0,Inequality as Relative Deprivation: A Sociological Approach to Inequality Measurement,"Although concerns for inequality are at the heart of the sociological tradition, few sociologists have taken a serious interest in the normative and methodological issues involved in the choice between different measures of inequality. It is argued in this article that the widely used but also widely criticized Gini index can be seen to incorporate a particularly sociological conception of inequality. The Gini index has features that are alien to mainstream welfare economics, but perfectly sensible if inequality is understood more sociologically as arising from a state of relative deprivation. However, the commitment to a relativistic conception of inequality leads to serious theoretical and practical complications. The implicit rationale of the Gini index assumes that it is applied to a 'reference population' -- where everybody compares themselves with everybody else. It is not obvious that the residents of a nation-state always constitute a reference population in this sense, and arguments can be found both for widening and narrowing the scope of the relevant population. Both aggregation and disaggregation from whatever is considered to be the 'appropriate' scope of the reference population is problematic and requires different methodological solutions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4195006,1991,Acta Sociologica,10.2307_4195006

The paper redresses this imbalance and examines the cultural structures that operate as preconditions for the attribution of charisma to political and religious leaders. Drawing on Weberian, Durkheimian and semiotic theory the paper argues that charisma arises in conjunction with salvation narratives. The internal structure of these narratives requires binary oppositions contrasting good and evil.

In this connection, an alternative 'action' perspective is discussed.

0,SOURCES OF DIVERSITY IN INTERNAL LABOUR MARKETS,"This paper sets out to examine the assumption made by radical economists that internal labour markets formed by large scale corporate employers provide a source of labour market dichotomization between 'core' and 'peripheral' employment. It criticizes the assumption that internal labour markets can be treated as a culturally neutral phenomenon emerging from the demands of technical rationality. Since, by definition, the boundaries of internal labour markets are institutionally defined, their forms and rationales display a cross-national diversity which indicates a difference in employer strategies and employee responses to the historical course of technological innovation. In particular it suggests that the struggle for task control over the mode of production represented in the creation of new occupations has, in the Anglo Saxon culture, been more likely to take place at the point of production, whereas in France it has been expressed in overtly class terms and in modern Germany in the bureaucratic control systems adopted by a corporate pluralistic state.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42853192,1983,Sociology,10.2307_42853192

By looking at the questions addressed in the debates of the 1980s and the 1990s, it outlines some of the issues which researchers have to address in developing new research agendas.

0,SOCIAL SOLIDARITY AND SOCIAL EXCHANGE,"Hechter's (1987) theory of group solidarity points to the need for clarification of the meaning of social solidarity and the related concept of social exchange. In order to clarify these conceptual issues, a distinction between social exchange and instrumental exchange is developed. Social exchange is motivated by a desire to promote or maintain a positive attitude from other group members, while instrumental exchange is a means of obtaining behaviour from others which promotes the self-interest of the actor. Social solidarity, in contrast, is characterised by the motive of promoting group goals in their own right, provided the actor perceives positive attitudes from others towards himself. A related distinction is then made between instrumental exchange and co-ordination. This yields a fourfold typology which shows an interesting correspondence with Parsons's AGIL scheme and sheds light on Habermas's distinction between social integration and system integration.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42855862,1997,Sociology,10.2307_42855862
0,Consumption Caught in the 'Cash Nexus',"During the last thirty years 'consumption' has become a major topic in the study of contemporary culture within anthropology, psychology and sociology. For many authors it has become central to understanding the nature of material culture in the modern world, but this paper argues that the concept is, in British writing at least, too concerned with its economic origins in the selling and buying of consumer goods or commodities. It is argued that to understand material culture as determined through the monetary exchange for things - the cash nexus - leads to an inadequate sociological understanding of the social relations with objects. The work of Jean Baudrillard is used both to critique the concept of consumption as it leads to a focus on advertising, choice, money and shopping and to point to a more sociologically adequate approach to material culture that explores objects in a system of models and series, 'atmosphere', functionality, biography, interaction and mediation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42856225,2000,Sociology,10.2307_42856225
0,The Relationship Between Gender Equality and Democracy: A Comparison of Arab Versus Non-Arab Muslim Societies,"Inglehart and Norris argue that the core clash between the Islamic world and the West is over issues concerning gender equality rather than democracy. However a comparison between Arab and non-Arab Muslim societies is essential before drawing this conclusion. Here, we compared nations from each society and found significant differences in attitudes toward gender equality, democratic governance and religious identities. We analyzed models predicting support for democracy including views toward gender equality in each set of countries. In non-Arab Muslim countries, there were higher levels of support for women's rights, and those who supported gender equality were significantly more likely to support democracy.The reverse was true in the Arab Muslim countries. We argue that for a complete and unbiased form of democracy to emerge in the Arab Middle East, a rule of law that would protect gender equality, minority rights and citizen inclusion would need to be instituted.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42858291,2007,Sociology,10.2307_42858291

0,CONFLICT IN NATURAL DISASTERS: A CODIFICATION OF CONSENSUS AND CONFLICT THEORIES,"This paper presents a codification of two different social science theories of conflict during the emergency period of natural disasters. Consensus theory proposes that conflict is absent due to the emergence of new norms in the disaster situation. Conflict theory, which to date exists only in fragmentary form in a handful of scattered writings, holds that natural disasters are inherently contentious. A major implication of conflict theory is that natural disasters are not politically neutral with respect to their consequences. Rather than mere ""acts of nature,"" disasters are directly influenced by preinterruption patterns of conflict and inequality. Despite the relative underdevelopment of a conflict theory of natural disasters, the use of its key causal hypotheses in future research is advocated.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42862439,1988,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42862439
0,"The Political Economy of New Business Formation across the American States, 1970-1985","Objective. The issue of whether state-sponsored investment incentives stimulate the formation of new businesses has not been resolved for a lack of adequate measures of state policy activity and because researchers have failed to consider the effects of other, perhaps more important, features of states' political economies. The purpose of this research is to examine the politicaleconomic determinants of new business formation across the American states between 1970 and 1985. Methods. This research tests the effects of a new measurement model of states' economic development policies and other factors suggested by Gordon, Edwards, and Reich's framework of social structures of accumulation using pooled cross-sectional time series analysis techniques. Results. Results show that new business formation is related to several dimensions of states' political economies, including the organizational capacity of labor, social wage policies, fiscal capacities, and the political/electoral context of states. By contrast, state-sponsored economic development policies have minimal effects. Conclusions. Findings attest to the severe problems that states face in trying to replace businesses lost to deindustrialization.

0,Civil Society and Agricultural Sustainability,"Objective. We show how the civil society perspective can be used to understand the dynamics associated with agricultural sustainability. Methods. Using data from the 1987 and 1992 Censuses of Agriculture, we identify two groups of counties based on their changes in farm profitability, chemical resource use, and farm numbers.One group of counties shows increased profitability, decreased resource use, and stable or increasing farm numbers. The other group of counties falls on the opposite end of these dimensions. Residualized regression techniques and discriminant analysis are used. Results. Variables derived from civil society are related to agricultural sustainability, net of controls on farmer characteristics, farm location, and commodities. Over 85 percent of the counties in our study were correctly classified as sustainable or nonsustainable by using six civil society measures.Conclusions.Civil society posits that the pathway to agricultural sustainability is found in the size, scale, and organizational characteristics of farms and the social matrix in which these farms are embedded. Middle-size, family operations are more conducive to sustainable agricultural development than large-scale, corporate farms.Agricultural sustainability is more prevalent in areas with high levels of civic engagement.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42863819,1998,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42863819
0,Immigration and Urban Violence: The Link between Immigrant Latinos and Types of Homicide,"Objective. Despite the perceived relationship between immigration and crime, scholars have advanced largely contradictory images of the effects of Latino immigration to urban areas. The goal of this paper is to establish the link between the size of urban Latino immigrant populations and the frequency of specific types of Latino homicide victimization rates. Methods. This research examines data from the 1980 Supplemental Homicide Reports (SHR) and the 1980 decennial census. While these data might not represent a contemporary situation, they are the only reliable source of information from government statistics. Results. Ordinary least squares regression analysis provides some support for economic deprivation and social disorganization interpretations of violence; however, the role of immigration varies by homicide type (e.g., felony and acquaintance killings) and is limited. Conclusions. These findings stress the need for addressing the link between immigration, urban conditions, and types of Latino homicide victimization.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42864387,2000,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42864387
0,The Culture of Academic Disciplines and the Sociopolitical Attitudes of Students: A Test of Selection and Socialization Effects,"Objective. Using cross-sectional and panel data, this article estimates to what extent the association between students' choice of academic discipline and their sociopolitical attitudes is due to socialization and selection effects. Methods. This is done on the basis of seven incoming cohorts of students and one panel of students. Changes in the panel are controlled for contextual influences by comparing them to a control group. Results. Both selection and socialization effects are observed. The first are, however, much stronger than the second. Conclusions. Although the literature, and particularly the more popular literature, highlights socialization effects, these turn out to be very modest. Future research should address the questions of how and why students select academic disciplines in a way that establishes strong relations between those disciplines and their sociopolitical attitudes.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42940596,2009,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42940596
0,Disproportionality and Disaster: Hurricane Katrina and the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet,"Objectives. Although many observers have interpreted Hurricane Katrina's damage to New Orleans as a case of nature striking humans, we draw on the sociological concept of the growth machine to show that much of the damage resulted instead from what humans had done to nature—in the name but not the reality of ""economic development."" Methods. We triangulate findings from multiple qualitative techniques, including first-hand fieldwork, interviews, and analyses of historical records. We focus on a particularly telling illustration: the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet, a transportation canal. Results. Although the canal was widely predicted to deliver prosperity, it mainly created environmental damage, destroying wetlands that had formerly protected New Orleans from hurricanes. Despite enthusiastic predictions about its economic importance—plus millions of dollars in ongoing federal investments—the ""outlet"" was used by only a dozen of the ships for which it was designed during the entire last year before Katrina hit. Conclusions. This was clearly not a case of an ""enduring conflict"" between the environment and the economy; it was a case where economic benefits to a tiny number of beneficiaries created profound costs to the environment, and to humans in turn. Claims about supposed ""economic benefits"" from environmentally harmful projects need to be examined more closely in other contexts, as well.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42940601,2009,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42940601
0,Third-Party Candidates and the 2000 Presidential Election,"Objective. This article examines how third-party candidates influenced the 2000 presidential election. Methods. Two surveys provide information on a hypothetical election between only George Bush and Al Gore. The determinants of voting behavior in this election are then used to estimate how votes cast for third-party candidates would have been partitioned between Bush, Gore, and abstentions had the other candidates dropped out of the race. Results. The estimates suggest that the Ralph Nader votes would have gone primarily to Gore (giving him the win in Florida) while Bush would have received more of the Pat Buchanan votes. The results also show that Nader's presence in the race gave Gore an incentive to position himself farther to the left ideologically. Bush's ideological position was not affected by Buchanan's participation. Conclusion. The third-party candidates' participation was a critical factor in George Bush's Electoral College victory over Al Gore.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42955889,2003,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42955889
0,The Differential Wage Impact of the Immigration Reform and Control Act on Latino Ethnic Subgroups,"Objective. This article tests whether employer sanctions for hiring undocumented workers, a provision of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), adversely affected the hourly earnings of Latino workers. Methods. Using the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group Files from 1983-1990, a natural experiment framework is developed to assess the differential wage impact of employer sanctions on Latino ethnic subgroups. Results. Estimates of wage changes indicate that workers of Mexican descent saw a sizeable pre-post IRCA decline in their hourly earnings relative to Cuban or Puerto Rican workers. Moreover, this change in wages is not observed among non-Latino white workers. Controlling for the level of enforcement explains part of this decline immediately following the passage of IRCA, and enforcement efforts continue to be a significant factor several years later. Conclusions. The majority of evidence is consistent with the contention that employer sanctions adversely affected the earnings of Mexican workers.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42956036,2005,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42956036
0,"Social Insurance Expansion and Political Regime Dynamics in Europe, 1880-1945","Objectives. This article analyzes the causal relationship between political regime dynamics and social insurance expansion. I theorize that the social insurance expansion is the result of the ruling elites' strategic decision about regime change to dispel revolutionary motives. The key testable implication is that social insurance expansion is more likely to happen under a democratic regime, which, in turn, is influenced by the threat of social revolution evinced by strike activities. Methods. Using historical data on social insurance coverage from 12 European countries from 1880 to 1945, I test the hypothesis employing a treatment-effects model that endogenizes democratization. Results. I find a positive association between social insurance expansion and democracy, controlling for other political mechanisms. Furthermore, I find that democratic transition is greatly influenced by the duration and intensity of strikes. Conclusion. This study suggests that social insurance expansion requires a link between a threat of revolution and democratization.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42956306,2007,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42956306
0,Formation Stories and Causality in Sociology,"Sociologists have long been interested in understanding the emergence of new social kinds.We argue that sociologists' formation stories have been mischaracterized as noncausal, descriptive, or interpretive. Traditional ""forcing-cause"" accounts describe regularized relations between fixed entities with specific properties. The three dominant approaches to causality—variable causality, treatments and manipulations, and mechanisms—all refer to forcing causes. But formation stories do not fit the forcing-causes framework because accounts of formation violate the assumptions that ground forcing-cause accounts and instead emphasize eventfulness, assemblage, and self-representation. Yet these accounts are, we argue, fundamentally causal. In particular, formation stories provide the historical, empirical boundaries for the functioning of forcing-cause accounts. We catalog the breadth of formation stories in sociology and use examples from diverse literatures to highlight how thinking of formation stories as causal accounts can improve our understanding of the relationship of history and culture to causal analysis.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43186678,2014,Sociological Theory,10.2307_43186678

0,Climate Change Vulnerability and Adaptation in Metro Manila: Challenging Governance and Human Security Needs of Urban Poor Communities,"Climate change and flooding in Asian cities pose great challenges to the environmental and human security of the population and their governance systems. This paper examines the intersections of ecological-environmental and social vulnerability and the adaptive responses of urban poor communities and commercial-industrial establishments in Metro Manila to floods and other climate change-related effects, such as storm surges and sea-level rise (SLR). These weaken the communities' ecological-environmental systems, threaten the well-being and security of the people and strain the resources of city governments. Disaggregating the ecological-environment vulnerabilities of a city/community according to specific places/spaces (or place-based vulnerabilities) that lead also to variable patterns among different groups (e.g., gender, income group, sector) of adaptive responses to flooding. Drawing a systematic sample of urban poor households and industrial-commercial establishments along the Pasig-Marikina River Basin of Metro Manila, this study utilised household surveys, key informant interviews, focus group discussions (FGD) and secondary data sources, in analysing the sources of their vulnerability and adaptive responses. Existing studies generally focus on the vulnerability and adaptation of urban-rural populations and do not highlight the interaction of place-based vulnerabilities with sector-specific vulnerabilities that reconfigure flood impacts and responses among the urban poor communities and commercial-industrial establishments during and after floods. In particular, poor and female-headed households residing in highly degraded environments or places/spaces within and across urban poor communities suffered higher damages and losses compared to better-off households and establishments. The interaction of these drivers of vulnerability further heightens and compromises the environmental and human security needs of poor people, their communities and those in the private sector that local/national government agencies need to respond.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43495780,2014,Asian Journal of Social Science,10.2307_43495780
0,"Being Special, Becoming Indigenous: Dilemmas of Special Adat Rights in Indonesia","From 1998 onwards Indonesias reform era (reformasi) has captured the imagination of growing numbers of observers, experts and scholars. Policies of decentralisation and enhanced public participation projects have reawakened old debates surrounding indigenous rights, power and status. This article examines the dilemma of special rights, particularly those related to the political revival of customs and traditions (adat istiadat). Calls for exigent recognition and redistributive rights for particular groups and 'unique' village communities frequently take the form of indirect regulatory negotiations and direct struggles for land. Case studies from Sulawesi are therefore used to examine heavily contested processes of decentralisation and local autonomy, which in many respects enable the revival of local adat. Distinctions are made between static and fluid views of adat, between being special by virtue of birthright on the one hand, and becoming indigenous by way of deliberate political intervention and mobilisation on the other.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43497847,2011,Asian Journal of Social Science,10.2307_43497847

The merits of the models introduced in this paper are their wide applicability to surveys that collect data on egocentric social networks and their ability to identify the determinants of agreement between subjects' and their friends' attitudinal or behavioral outcomes, controlling for the tendency to agree because of homophily in the choice of friends. An illustrative application from the Japanese General Social Survey data shows that several substantively distinct characteristics of egocentric networks affect subjects' political party preferences and the extent of agreement between the political party preferences of subjects and their significant others.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43551660,2013,Sociological Methodology,10.2307_43551660

Seventy-seven groups which were led by African-American and white men and women were observed over a two-year period. Group behavior was scored for positive reactions, negative reactions, and disruptive behavior. Major findings were: groups that had a higher proportion of girls responded more positively; larger groups tended to display more disruptive behavior; older children displayed more negative responses; men elicited more positive reactions and women elicited more negative reactions; and white men and African-American women elicited the most disruptive behavior.

0,Monotheistic Theodicy as Imaginary Face-Work,"In this article, I outline the cognitive process involved in accomplishing monotheistic theodicy, or the act of reconciling the belief in an omnipotent and morally perfect God with personal experiences of suffering. Based on in-depth interviews with intimate partner violence victims, I argue that believers accomplish monotheistic theodicy by performing imaginary face-work—or protective face-work on the behalf of significant imagined others—that saves God's face as a morally perfect being. Believers perform this imaginary face-work by constructing accounts that portray God as morally innocent of their suffering. These accounts fall into three main types: (1) fidelity to a higher principle, (2) ultimate benefit, and (3) shifting blame. These accounts serve as new cognitions that resolve the cognitive dissonance and concomitant negative emotions believers experience because of their suffering. Overall, the findings and analysis contribute to sociological theory by further extending the concepts of face and face-work to imagined others.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43654150,2014,Sociological Forum,10.2307_43654150
0,The Emergence of Penal Extremism in California: A Dynamic View of Institutional Structures and Political Processes,"This article examines legal and political developments in California in the 1970s and early 1980s that led to extreme changes in the state's use of imprisonment. It uses historical research methods to illustrate how institutional and political processes interacted in dynamic ways that continuously unsettled and reshaped the crime policy field. It examines crime policy developments before and after the passage of the state's determinate sentencing law to highlight the law's long-term political implications and to illustrate how it benefited interest groups pushing for harsher punishment. It emphasizes the role executives played in shaping these changes, and how the law's significance was as much political as legal because it transformed the institutional logics that structured criminal lawmaking. These changes, long sought by the law enforcement lobby, facilitated crime's politicization and ushered in a new era of frenetic and punitive changes in criminal law and punishment. This new context benefited politicians who supported extreme responses to crime and exposed the crime policy process to heightened degrees of popular scrutiny. The result was a political obsession with crime that eschewed moderation and prioritized prison expansion above all else.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43670397,2014,Law & Society Review,10.2307_43670397
0,AN ACADEMIC MODEL FOR COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH,"Driven by the dual goals of training students to apply their research skills in a community setting and providing much needed research to local community and governmental agencies, three social science professors created a center to conduct community research. This address details the steps used to build clientele in the community and discusses how to integrate applied research with academic expectations. Three major issues are addressed. The first consists of building relationships with community entities to acquire the necessary opportunities for research and, in so doing, for funding the program. The second involves educating faculty colleagues and university administrators to provide institutional support for community research. The third concerns developing applied courses with minimal faculty that meet the academic demands of a university, while protecting the privacy needs and meeting the time constraints of community clients.

0,What Sociologists Do and Where They Do It—The NSF Survey on Sociologists's Work Activities and Workplaces,"We present data from the National Science Foundation Survey of Doctoral Recipients that challenges the image of sociology as a classroom-based group of professionals. Our data reveal that only 45.8% of Ph.D. sociologists teach sociology. The anachronistic and false image of sociology, we argue, is profoundly consequential to the way sociologists interact with each other and with the larger society. As a discipline we tend to ignore or dismiss the doing of sociology in favor of the teaching of sociology or of theoretically focused research. We also present data on principal tasks and job classifications for those in academic and nonacademic settings.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43735950,1999,Sociological Practice,10.2307_43735950
0,Longitudinal Associations among Discordant Sexual Orientation Dimensions and Hazardous Drinking in a Cohort of Sexual Minority Women,"We examined differences between sexual minority women's (SMW's) sexual identity and sexual behavior or sexual attraction as potential contributors to hazardous drinking across a 10-year period. Data are from a longitudinal study examining drinking and drinking-related problems in a diverse, community-based sample of self-identified SMW (Wave 1: n = 447; Wave 2: n = 384; Wave 3: n = 354). Longitudinal cross-lagged models showed that SMW who report higher levels of identity-behavior or identity-attraction discordance may be at greater risk of concurrent and subsequent hazardous drinking. Results of multigroup models suggest that sexual orientation discordance is a more potent risk factor for risky drinking outcomes among SMW in older adulthood than in younger adulthood. Findings support that discordance between sexual orientation dimensions may contribute to hazardous drinking among SMW and provide evidence that cognitive-behavioral consistency is important for individuals expressing diverse and fluid sexual identities, attraction, and behavior.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/44001135,2015,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_44001135
0,Understanding the Selection Bias: Social Network Processes and the Effect of Prejudice on the Avoidance of Outgroup Friends,"Research has found that prejudiced people avoid friendships with members of ethnic outgroups. Results of this study suggest that this effect is mediated by a social network process. Longitudinal network analysis of a three-wave panel study of 12- to 13-year-olds (N = 453) found that more prejudiced majority group members formed fewer intergroup friendships than less prejudiced majority group members. This was caused indirectly by the preference to become friends of one's friends' friends (triadic closure). More prejudiced majority members did not have a preference for actively avoiding minority group members. Rather, they had the tendency to avoid friends who already had minority group friends and thus could not be introduced to potential minority group friends. Instead they became friends with the majority group friends of their friends. This research shows how a social networks perspective can further our understanding of the processes underlying intergroup contact.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/44076822,2015,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_44076822
0,Religious Dimensions of Political Conflict and Violence,"This paper seeks to develop a nuanced and qualified account of the distinctive ways in which religion can inform political conflict and violence. It seeks to transcend the opposition between particularizing stances, which see religiously informed political conflicts as sui generis and uniquely intractable, and generalizing stances, which assimilate religiously informed political conflicts to other forms of political conflict. The paper specifies the distinctively religious stakes of certain political conflicts, informed by distinctively religious understandings of right order, as well as the distinctiveness of religion as a rich matrix of interlocking modalities and mechanisms that—in certain contexts—can contribute to political conflict and violence even when the stakes are not distinctively religious. At the same time, the paper shows that many putatively religious conflicts are fundamentally similar to other conflicts over political power, economic resources, symbolic recognition, or cultural reproduction.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/44114430,2015,Sociological Theory,10.2307_44114430

0,"Neighborhood Foreclosures, Racial/Ethnic Transitions, and Residential Segregation","In this article, we use data on virtually all foreclosure events between 2005 and 2009 to calculate neighborhood foreclosure rates for nearly all block groups in the United States to assess the impact of housing foreclosures on neighborhood racial/ethnic change and on broader patterns of racial residential segregation. We find that the foreclosure crisis was patterned strongly along racial lines: black, Latino, and racially integrated neighborhoods had exceptionally high foreclosure rates. Multilevel models of racial/ethnic change reveal that foreclosure concentrations were linked to declining shares of whites and expanding shares of black and Latino residents. Results further suggest that these compositional shifts were driven by both white population loss and minority growth, especially from racially mixed settings with high foreclosure rates. To explore the impact of these racially selective migration streams on patterns of residential segregation, we simulate racial segregation assuming that foreclosure rates remained at their 2005 levels throughout the crisis period. Our simulations suggest that the foreclosure crisis increased racial segregation between blacks and whites by 1.1 dissimilarity points, and between Latinos and whites by 2.2 dissimilarity points.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/44289578,2015,American Sociological Review,10.2307_44289578

0,Income and Life Satisfaction After Marital Disruption in Germany,"Divorce in Germany and in many other countries is often instigated by the wife, even though marital disruption has much more negative economic consequences for women than for men. Both observations, however, are not necessarily a contradiction. Women may gain something that makes up for the economic loss. On the one hand, using data on income and (general) life satisfaction from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, this article shows that negative economic changes, as measured by data on household income, are real in the sense that they are reflected in subjective assessments of economic well-being. On the other hand, these changes are relative because other aspects of life improve after marriage dissolution, and this is especially true for women.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4622452,1975,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_4622452
0,Domestic Neglect and Abuse of the Elderly: Implications for Research and Service,"Until 1978 no information was published about domestic mistreatment of the elderly in their homes by relatives or other domestic caregivers. Between 1978 and 1980 six separate investigations of neglect and abuse of elderly persons in their homes were conducted in the United States. Of these studies two were observational case studies, one was a review of medical records, two were mail surveys of human service providers and one was a field study with personal interviews with community practitioners and professionals. All of these investigations agree that a substantial but undocumented problem of domestic neglect and abuse of the elderly exists. The variety and severity of mistreatment ranges from reasonably benign to very severe, and causal theories are numerous. This paper reviews the existing and very limited state of knowledge in this new area of concern, and highlights the findings of the Michigan field study with emphasis on a comparative analysis of findings among different kinds of community professionals and practitioners.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/584617,1980,Family Relations,10.2307_584617

0,Bending the Bars of the Iron Cage: Bureaucratization and Informalization in Capitalism and Socialism,"Despite some important similarities, capitalism's informal economy and socialism's second economy are not functional equivalents or structural counterparts. An informal economy is the product of efforts to circumvent accountability to the explicit rationalizations of regulatory bureaucratization. It operates according to principles disparate from those of the rules of internal labor markets but congruent with the market principles that coordinate the formal economy. In the centrally planned economies of state socialism where informalization responds to the contradictions of redistributive bureaucratization, the embryonic market relations of the second economy are incongruent with the bureaucratic principles that coordinate the formal economy, and in fact, stimulate the institutionalization of transactive market relations and the expansion of property rights inside the socialist enterprise. As a sphere of activity relatively autonomous from the state, the second economy is a source of fundamental change remaking the economic institutions of socialism.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/684428,1978,Sociological Forum,10.2307_684428
0,Social Structures and Economic Conduct: Interpreting Variations in Household Energy Consumption,"The consumption of natural resources is rapidly emerging as a major social problem, and social efforts to control this consumption are guided in part by research that tries to specify the meaning of resources to consumers. This paper compares a sociological perspective with the more widespread economic model of consumption, using data from study of billing systems, sociocultural status, and household energy use in a California apartment complex. The research suggests that the role of marginal price in ordering consumption can be interpreted as a contingent feature of the socially structured relationship between consumption and social status. It also suggests that the utility of a technology is a secondary and emergent product of its use, a fact obscured by the conventional analytic separation of supply and demand or means and ends.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/684514,1982,Sociological Forum,10.2307_684514
0,Worldviews or Social Groups as the Source of Moral Value Attitudes: Implications for the Culture Wars Thesis,"Individual moral value attitudes are typically explained by reference to social experiences as indicated by social group variables. Contrary to this view, the emergent ""culture wars"" perspective claims that two worldviews that transcend social groups are ultimately and fundamentally responsible for moral value attitudes. Although this relationship has been claimed for the general population, it has not been investigated with national representative data. This paper contrasts the worldview and social group explanations by examining the relative importance of the worldviews implicated in the culture wars literature and the social groups found to be important in previous research. I find social groups to be more important than worldviews, but that worldviews also have explanatory power. I conclude with a discussion about possible clarifications of the ""culture wars"" thesis.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/685054,1996,Sociological Forum,10.2307_685054
0,Industrial Segmentation and Labor Market Discrimination,"The economic segmentation literature suggests two mechanisms by which the inferior position of minority within the socioeconomic structure of industrial capitalism is perpetuated. The first is the differential allocation of minority labor to different segments of the industrial economy, and the second is the differential evaluation of minority credentials within different industrial segments. Using data from the 1976 Current Population Survey we evaluate each of these two mechanisms. We find that while there are significant earnings costs due to the differential allocation of minority labor into the labor-intensive sector of the economy, the dollar costs of the differential evaluation of minority credentials are far greater. This is especially apparent in the capital-intensive sector where the penalties paid by minorities are substantial, especially for white females but also for nonwhites of either sex.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/800146,1978,Social Problems,10.2307_800146
0,Female Participation in the Occupational System: A Comparative Institutional Analysis,"This paper uses cross-national data to examine how economic, political, and educational structures affect both the participation of women in the labor force and their employment in more powerful and well-rewarded positions. We find that both the level of industrialization and the degree of state corporateness positively influence the participation of women, but that these fail to affect the proportion of women in the administrative and managerial occupations. However, the relative number of women in higher education shows positive effects on both dependent variables. We interpret this finding as a process of 'institutional demystification' and discuss the overall pattern of effects as 'incorporation at the rear of the bus.'",https://www.jstor.org/stable/800481,1974,Social Problems,10.2307_800481
0,Got Land? Thank an Indian: Settler Colonialism and the White Settler in the Karuk Ancestral Territory,"From the time of European invasion of what now constitutes the United States, the settler colonial system has aimed to exterminate Indigenous Peoples and replace them with settlers on the land. While settler colonialism benefits the settler at the cost of the Indigenous, all life on Earth suffers from the continuation of this system. This research examines how white settlers living in the Karuk Ancestral Territory, located in Humboldt County, California, understand our role in the settler colonial system. The goal of this study is to begin a collective pursuit of a white settler ethic of accountability, which is a difficult task even in preliminary stages, as it requires the admission of being a beneficiary of and accomplice to the vicious system of settler colonialism. This could bring about the loss of an already fragile identity and an insecure settler future. Yet settler society has a responsibility to face our role in the settler colonial system.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/humjsocrel.36.59,2004,Humboldt Journal of Social Relations,10.2307_humjsocrel.36.59
