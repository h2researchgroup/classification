While this can be helpful, it may also confuse scholars who are attempting to conduct research in these areas. This narrative reflects on these three interrelated streams of research and provides a useful framework for comparing them. The framework provides a basis for comparing and contrasting these constructs and their attributes. Although this study attempts to provide a theoretical integration, it is also careful to leave theoretical distinctions intact. Brief examples are included to clarify the salient features of each theory while integrating their similarities and attending to their differences.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25822540,2011,Journal of Managerial Issues,10.2307_25822540,0.75448668,227,7,0.613030136,33,1,0.560982883,119,0
1,0,0,Rational Decision Making as Performative Praxis: Explaining Rationality's Éternel Retour,"Organizational theorists built their knowledge of decision making through a progressive critique of rational choice theory. Their positioning towards rationality, however, is at odds with the observation of rationality persistence in organizational life. This paper addresses this paradox. It proposes a new perspective on rationality that allows the theorizing of the production of rational decisions by organizations. To account for rationality's éternel retour, we approach rational decision making as performative praxis—a set of activities that contributes to turning rational choice theory into social reality. We develop a performative praxis framework that explains how theory, actors, and tools together produce rationality within organizations through three mechanisms: rationality conventionalization, rationality engineering, and rationality commodification. This framework offers new avenues of research on rational decision making and points to the factors that underlie the manufacture of rationality in organizations.",external-fulltext-any,2011,Organization Science,10.2307_20868880,0.721939445,55,6,0.588276327,16,1,0.534615278,2,0

The emergent features of China's economic order are analyzed with reference to the business system developing there, in particular, the nature of market arrangements, the form of capitalism, and the role of government within that system.

Using data on the entries of 215 U.S. public firms made into 11 Central and Eastern European transition economies during the period of 1990–2003, we find that shifts in national institutional environments, from a socialist to a market economy, reduce the extent of challenges encountered to make a hierarchical entry, which leads to an increase in foreign hierarchical entry attempts but not necessarily to a decrease in relational entry attempts as institutional transformation. We find evidence of inertial influences as experienced entrants tend to follow their previous decisions when making subsequent entry attempts. Further, they are less responsive in their foreign entry strategies to the institutional transformation in a given host country than inexperienced firms. We also find that the experience gained from relational entries results in more hierarchical entry attempts, but hierarchical entry experience results in fewer relational entry attempts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27735492,2009,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_27735492,0.638905942,174,3,0.671659827,64,0,0.615820825,50,5

To explore this, a four-stage, cross-cultural (ie Australia and United States) qualitative study was undertaken to examine the role the Outback Steakhouse chain of restaurants plays in representing Australian culture in the United States. Findings revealed that US subjects were more accepting of the restaurant environment where it matched the images of Australia perpetuated by the media.

We hypothesize that internal and external rivals evoke contrasting kinds of threats. Specifically, using knowledge from an internal rival is difficult because it threatens the self and its competence: It is tantamount to being a ""follower"" and losing status relative to a direct competitor. By contrast, external rivals pose a lower threat to personal status, so people are more willing to use their knowledge. We conducted three studies. Study 1 showed that internal and external rivalry involved opposite relationships between threat and knowledge valuation: The more threat internal rivals provoked, the more people avoided their knowledge, whereas the more threat external rivals provoked, the more people pursued their knowledge. Study 2 explored the types of threat that insiders and outsiders evoked. In particular, people assumed that they would lose more personal status if they used an internal rival's knowledge and, therefore, reduced their valuation of that knowledge. Finally, Study 3 found that self-affirmation attenuated these patterns.

It demonstrates evidence of commercial hospitality activities through the excavation hotels, bars and taverns, restaurants and fast food sites. The paper also provides an example of the benefits to be gained from multi-disciplinary analysis of hospitality and tourism.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23745412,2007,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23745412,0.642154813,14,0,0.511248887,6,0,0.495625854,1,0
0,0,0,"Change and Complementarities in the New Competitive Landscape: A European Panel Study, 1992-1996","This paper addresses three weaknesses in the literature on new organizational forms: the limited mapping of the extent of contemporary organizational change; confusion about how contemporary changes link together; and the lack of systematic testing of the performance consequences of this kind of change. Drawing on a large-scale survey of organizational innovation in European firms, the paper finds widespread but not revolutionary change in terms of organization structure, processes, and boundaries. Using the economics notion of complementarities, the paper develops contingency and configurational approaches to suggest that organizational innovations will tend to cluster in particular ways and that the performance benefits of these innovations depend on their clustering. Complementarities in performance are explored from both inductive and deductive perspectives. Consistent with the expectations of complementarity theory, high-performing firms appeared to be innovating more and differently than low-performing firms. Again consistent with complementarities, piecemeal changes-with the exception of IT-were found to deliver little performance benefit, while exploitation of the full set of innovations was associated with high performance. Though few European firms were found to exploit the complementarities of new organizational practices, those that did enjoyed high-performance premia.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640319,1992,Organization Science,10.2307_2640319,0.637125552,26,0,0.658691704,60,0,0.581359386,31,2

The authors argue that the process of technological adaptation is not gradual and continuous, as often argued in the innovation literature, but is instead highly discontinuous. Evidence from three manufacturing and service organizations indicates that there exists a relatively brief window of opportunity to explore and modify new process technology following initial implementation. Afterwards, modification of new process technologies by users is limited by the increasing routinization that occurs with experience. Thus, the technology and its context of use tend to congeal, often embedding unresolved problems into organizational practice. Subsequent changes appear to occur in an episodic manner, triggered either by discrepant events or by new discoveries on the part of users. These findings have important implications for theories of technological change.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635073,1986,Organization Science,10.2307_2635073,0.630327106,24,0,0.597588241,19,0,0.558688581,4,0

We integrate research on experiential learning and cultural intelligence to propose a process model that focuses on how leaders translate their international work assignment experiences into learning outcomes critical for global leadership development. Our model positions cultural intelligence as a moderator that enhances the likelihood that individuals on international assignments will actively engage in the four stages of experiential learning (experience, reflect, conceptualize, experiment), which in turn leads to global leadership self-efficacy, ethnorelative attitudes toward other cultures, accurate mental models of leadership across cultures, and flexibility of leadership styles.

We hypothesize that symbiotic and commensalistic interpopulation relations function as channels of information about entrepreneurial opportunities and that differing access to such information influences the founding rate. Empirical analyses of U.S. instruments manufacturers support this argument. The founding rate of instruments manufacturers rises with the densities of organizational populations that have symbiotic and commensalistic relationships with instruments manufacturers. These factors encourage the initial foundings of instruments manufacturers in areas where such organizations were not previously found. The dominance of organizational populations tied to instruments manufacturing by symbiotic or commensalistic relations increases the rate of foundings of instruments manufacturers, whereas the dominance of organizational populations that lack these relations decreases it. Finally, we find that interpopulation relationships that hinge on direct contact have less impact on initial foundings as geographic distance increases.

Much of the work on diversity management (DM) has, however, been done in the developed world. With this background in mind, this research set out to analyse Zimbabwean hotel managers' perspectives on workforce diversity, and DM practices in Zimbabwe's hotel industry. Data were collected through an interview survey with 38 human resource managers in 38 hotels located in various towns around Zimbabwe.

A field simulation was conducted to determine the effects that contract wording has on perceived levels of trust in Japanese-American joint ventures. Results of the research indicate that Americans perceive a higher level of trust when contract wording is detailed and complete, whereas the formal agreement has less of an effect on the perceived trust of the Japanese. Rather, the Japanese look to the overall relationship, with all its informal agreements and implicit understandings, when assessing trust in a joint venture arrangement.

The findings indicate that even a strong emphasis on culture taught within the framework of a highly integrated, interdisciplinary international business program, with a student population that ought in theory to be particularly receptive to cultural matters, is not enough in itself to guarantee that students engage with culture seriously during their studies.

By a committee, we mean any group of people who have to pick one option from a given set of alternatives. A well defined voting rule is specified by which the committee arrives at a decision. Each member has a preference relation on the set of all alternatives. A new solution concept called the one-core is introduced and studied. Intuitively, the one-core consists of all maximal (for the proposer) proposals which are undominated assuming that the player who makes the proposal does not cooperate in any effort to dominate the proposal. For games with non-emtpy cores, the one-core proposals are shown to be better than the core. For games with empty cores, the one-core proposals tend to be pessimistic, i.e., they indicate the security level of the players. This is because the stability requirements of the one-core are too strong for such games. A bargaining set modeled along the lines of the Aumann-Maschler bargaining set for characteristic function games is defined for committee games. Because of its relaxed stability requirements, the bargaining set indicates more reasonable proposals than the one-core.

Factor analysis technique was implemented resulting in three factors, representing different dimensions of the wine tourism experience, and explained 43.9 per cent of the total variance. Factor scores were calculated and used for comparisons between different segments. The findings indicated that different segments yielded different importance ratings for each dimension. Fundamental differences occurred among specific segment bases: winery visitation frequency, subjects having children less than 18 years and wine involvement.

Two different ways of organizing assembly work were compared, (1) a more traditional assembly line with fixed work stations organized as a chain and involving short repetitive work cycles and, (2) a new and more flexible work organization with small autonomous groups having greater opportunities to influence the pace and content of their work. Each worker was examined during and after a normal day at work on 2 consecutive days and, in order to obtain endocrine baseline data, during a corresponding work-free period at home. As expected, both female and male workers in the flexible organization reported significantly more variation, independence and abilities to learn new skills at work. Workers in both forms of work organization showed a significant increase in urinary epinephrine and norepinephrine during work compared to the work-free day at home. Males had significantly higher epinephrine and systolic blood pressure levels than females. Successive self-reports of tiredness increased significantly more at the assembly line compared to the flexible work organization. In keeping with this, systolic blood pressure, heart rate and epinephrine increased significantly during the work shift at the assembly line but not during work in the flexible organization. Catecholamine levels revealed that the subjects were able to unwind more rapidly after work in the flexible organization. This pattern was particularly pronounced for the female workers.

However, the power of such models may tempt researchers to trust that they continue to produce reasonable estimates, when in fact either model misspecification or insufficient data limits the models' ability to recover household-level parameters successfully. If household-level choice behaviors are not recovered successfully, managerial decisions such as marketing-mix planning and targeting, direct marketing, segmentation, and forecasting may not produce the desired results. This study addresses the following questions. First, can random coefficients choice models correctly identify markets characterized by preference and response heterogeneity, state dependence, the use of alternative decision heuristics that result in reduced choice sets, and combinations of these effects? If so, how much data is required, and is this realistic given the size of data sets typically used in marketing analyses? Which model selection criteria should be used to identify these markets? When there is spurious market identification, which parameters contribute to the spurious result? An extensive simulation experiment is conducted wherein random coefficients logit models with varying specifications of parameter heterogeneity, state dependence effects, and choice set heterogeneity are applied to 128 experimental conditions. The results show which types of markets can be identified reliably and which cannot. Based on the results of the simulation, the authors develop a model selection heuristic that identifies the correct market in 81% of the experimental conditions. In contrast, strict application of the best model selection criterion alone results in correct market identification in at most 34% of experimental conditions. Interestingly, we find that the amount of data (number of households or number of purchases per household) does not affect our ability to identify the correct market type with this heuristic, so there is a good chance of identifying the correct market type even when little data is available.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20122362,2008,Management Science,10.2307_20122362,0.471214533,1,0,0.553741753,92,0,0.560987234,18,0

Two different techniques for dealing with open order due date changes are analyzed using customer service level and total inventory level performance measures. With the first technique, called the fixed due date approach, due dates are never changed from those originally assigned to orders when released to the shop. With the second technique, called the dynamic due date approach, all due dates are updated to reflect actual need dates. Beyond evaluating them in an MRP context, this study extends current understanding of these two techniques by observing them in a variety of different operating environments. The results of the study indicate that: (1) the dynamic due date approach performs as good as, or better than, the fixed due date approach across a wide range of operating conditions; and (2) operating conditions have an important effect on the magnitude of the performance differential between the two approaches.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2632105,1979,Management Science,10.2307_2632105,0.47040692,0,0,0.524660587,11,0,0.499713391,2,0

0,0,0,Measuring and Mitigating the Costs of Stockouts,"There is now an extensive theoretical literature investigating optimal inventory policies for retailers. Yet several recent reviews have recognized that these models are rarely applied in practice. One explanation for the paucity of practical applications is the difficulty of measuring how stockouts affect both current and future demand. In this paper, we report the findings of a large-scale field test that measures the short- and long-run opportunity cost of a stockout. The findings confirm that the adverse impact of a stockout extends to both other items in the current order as well as future orders. We show how the findings can be used to provide input to inventory planning models and illustrate how failing to account for the long-run effects of a stockout will lead to suboptimal inventory decisions. We also demonstrate how the findings can be used in a customer lifetime value model. Finally, the study investigates the effectiveness of different responses that firms can offer to mitigate the cost of stockouts. There is considerable variation in the effectiveness of these responses. Offering discounts to encourage customers to backorder rather than cancel their orders is widely used in practice, but that was the least profitable of the responses that we evaluated. The findings have important implications for retailers considering the use of discounts as a response to stockouts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20110646,2006,Management Science,10.2307_20110646,0.467529684,0,0,0.576867402,16,0,0.539450526,11,0

We find substantial heterogeneity across classes and countries in promotion and diffusion. In terms of diffusion, relative prices of old vs. new drugs, and intensity of detailing physicians, we find that somewhat surprisingly, the US is often ""in the middle"" relative to other countries, and is not an outlier. However, differences across classes are striking. Overall, new drug quantity elasticities with respect to own price are negative, ranging from about -0.75 to -1.1, while cross-price (new drug quantity with respect to old drug price) are positive but small.

0,0,0,A Light-Traffic Approximation for Single-Class Departure Processes from Multi-Class Queues,"This paper discusses an approximation for single-class departure processes from multi-class queues: If the arrival rate of one class upon one visit to the queue is a small proportion of the total arrival rate there, then the departure process for that class from that visit should be nearly the same as the arrival process for that class for that visit. This can be regarded as a light-traffic approximation, but only the one class must be in light traffic; the overall traffic intensity of the queue need not be low. As a consequence, in a queueing network if the routing for one class is deterministic, and if the light-traffic condition applies at every queue this class visits, then the arrival and departure processes for this class at each visit to each queue should be nearly the same as its external arrival process. This approximation is explained in terms of different time scales, and is justified here by a limit theorem in a special case. There are important implications for parametric decomposition approximation techniques: the variability parameter partially characterizing the departure process at any visit to any queue of such a low-intensity class should be nearly the same as the variability parameter partially characterizing the arrival process for that class at that visit to that queue. The approximation principle in this form was recently proposed by G. Bitran and D. Tirupati while developing improved parametric-decomposition approximations for low-variability multi-class queueing networks with deterministic routing, which have important applications in manufacturing. The approximation principle also has important implications for data networks, showing how burstiness in originated traffic can pass through heavily shared network facilities where it has relatively little effect and then reappear at the destination.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631997,1982,Management Science,10.2307_2631997,0.459183335,1,0,0.498119891,41,0,0.517121136,0,0

In these environments, the notion of schedule robustness, i.e., determining the schedule with the best worst-case performance compared to the corresponding optimal solution over all potential realizations of job processing times, is a more appropriate guide to schedule selection. In this paper, we formalize the robust scheduling concept for scheduling situations with uncertain or variable processing times. To illustrate the development of solution approaches for a robust scheduling problem, we consider a single-machine environment where the performance criterion of interest is the total flow time over all jobs. We define two measures of schedule robustness, formulate the robust scheduling problem, establish its complexity, describe properties of the optimal schedule, and present exact and heuristic solution procedures.

Little attention has been given to the larger segment of most consumer goods markets in which retailers compete to sell multiple brands at the same location. This research seeks to add to the growing literature of channel competition by analyzing three channel structures, the least constrained of which deals with two competing manufacturers and two retailers, each of whom distributes both products in a noncooperative game with two Nash's and one Stackleberg equilibrium. Using differentiated products and a linear demand function, we introduce the concept of ""store substitutability""-a measure corresponding to product substitutability representing competitiveness at the retail level-between the two retailers. We are able to obtain closed form solutions for all cases. We show that the presence of competitive effects at both retail and manufacturer levels of distribution has a significant impact on profits and prices. We also study the effects of various power relationships in the channel. Furthermore, we compare these results to those obtained by previous research.

Our model considers four factors: (1) the usable life of the product, (2) the rates at which consumers use the product, (3) the relation between package size and the variable cost of the product, and (4) the minimum quantities consumers seek to consume for each dollar they spend (we call these reservation quantities). We allow heterogeneity in the usage rates and reservation quantities for the consumers. We show that when the cost increases as a linear or convex function of the package size, the firm should make packages of the smallest possible size. Smaller packages reduce waste and allow consumers to more closely match their purchases with desired consumption. This in turn allows the firm to charge a higher unit price and also sell more unit volume. The results imply that in a market with multiple package sizes (produced by the same or competing firms), at least one of the packages must have the smallest possible size, provided the fixed cost of making the product is sufficiently low. For concave cost functions, the firm may find it optimal to make larger than smallest-size packages.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27784128,2010,Management Science,10.2307_27784128,0.419608176,0,0,0.537113309,3,0,0.526873112,3,0

Much expansion lies in areas far beyond the traditional foci on technical production or political power, such as protecting the environment, promoting marginalized groups, or behaving with transparency. We argue that expansion is supported by widespread cultural rationalization in a stateless and liberal global society, characterized by scientism, rights and empowerment discourses, and an explosion of education. These cultural changes are transmitted through legal, accounting, and professionalization principles, driving the creation of new organizations and the elaboration of existing ones. The resulting organizations are constructed to be proper social actors as much as functionally effective entities. They are painted as autonomous and integrated but depend heavily on external definitions to sustain this depiction. So expansion creates organizations that are, whatever their actual effectiveness, structurally nonrational. We advance institutional theories of social organization in three main ways. First, we give an account of the expansive rise of ""organization"" rooted in rapid worldwide cultural rationalization. Second, we explain the construction of contemporary organizations as purposive actors, rather than passive bureaucracies. Third, we show how the expanded actorhood of the contemporary organization, and the associated interpnetration with the environment, dialectically generate structures far removed from instrumental rationality.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43187345,2013,Sociological Theory,10.2307_43187345,0.728997767,137,4,0.622598052,71,0,0.564870119,17,0

The debate occurred on a university listserv and involved more than 100 messages offered by 67 individuals over 16 days. Analyses reveal four distinct framing contests in the discourse. An initiating contest regarding a specific antiwar protest is found to generate three additional contests, the first about antiwar protests more generally, the second about the war in Iraq itself, and the third about the appropriateness of holding such a debate on a listserve sent to university employees.

1,0,0,Symbolic Interaction and Applied Social Research: A Focus on Translational Science,"In symbolic interaction, a traditional yet unfortunate and unnecessary distinction has been made between basic and applied research. The argument has been made that basic research is intended to generate new knowledge, whereas applied research is intended to apply knowledge to the solution of practical (social and organizational) problems. I will argue that the distinction between basic and applied research in symbolic interaction is outdated and dysfunctional. The masters of symbolic interactionist thought have left us a proud legacy of shaping their scholarly thinking and inquiry in response to and in light of practical issues of the day (e.g., Park and Blumer). Current interactionist work continues this tradition in topical areas such as social justice studies. Applied research, especially in term of evaluation and needs assessment studies, can be designed to serve both basic and applied goals. Symbolic interaction provides three great resources to do this. The first is its orientation to dynamic sensitizing concepts that direct research and ask questions instead of supplying a priori and often impractical answers. The second is its orientation to qualitative methods, and appreciation for the logic of grounded theory. The third is interactionism's overall holistic approach to interfacing with the everyday life world. The primary illustrative case here is the qualitative component of the evaluation of an National Institutes of Health-funded, translational medical research program. The qualitative component has provided interactionist-inspired insights into translational research, such as examining cultural change in medical research in terms of changes in the form and content of formal and informal discourse among scientists; delineating the impact of significant symbols such as “my lab” on the social organization of science; and appreciating the essence of the self-concept “scientist” on the increasingly bureaucratic and administrative identities of medical researchers.

Recent studies have focused on relations between new ascendant social movements like the civil rights, women's, and peace movements that emerged during the postwar cycle of protest, and therefore have been unable to address this question. Focusing on revitalization as a qualitatively different form of intermovement relation, the authors examine the possibility that civil rights movement insurgencies and organizations revitalized workplace labor militancy during the postwar decades. Time-series models show that the civil rights movement fueled an expanded militant worker culture that challenged management and sometimes union leadership. However, this revitalization of labor militancy was contingent on institutional context (stronger in the public sector than the private sector) and form of insurgent action (protests, riots, organizations) differentially embedded in historical phases (civil rights versus Black Power) of movement development.

The education system played a vital role in transmitting this knowledge to the masses, thus beginning a process of internalisation on their part. This led to a rapid disintegration of Malay cultural practices and way of life as they comprehended alien Western concepts, such as history, territory and community.

The movement's legacy continues to play out in current and contentious electoral politics, since the leaders of the top contending parties are former Solidarity activists. Despite and partly because of this active presence of Solidarity movement players, Polish civil society appears to be in a liminal state of active hesitation over the task of concretizing this movement's past in commemorative forms. This article proposes six cultural and political explanations for this hesitation. It also recommends that social scientists disaggregate the concept of memory work into various manifestations on a continuum from hesitation to deliberation and agitation to institutionalization. As the article illustrates, hesitation can constitute action.

Believers perform this imaginary face-work by constructing accounts that portray God as morally innocent of their suffering. These accounts fall into three main types: (1) fidelity to a higher principle, (2) ultimate benefit, and (3) shifting blame.

Interviews with Navajo women revealed distinct patterns in their self-identification as Navajo and as Indian. Women who were born prior to the self-determination movements of the 1960s and who grew up in the context of Navajo communities distanced themselves from, and actively disrupted, negative and Stereotypic representations of Indians, drawing on their specific tribal identities to do so. Women born after 1960 were less likely to distance themselves from Indian identity, but also reframed the meanings associated with that identity. These results illustrate the importance of womens strategies for cultural survival and their use of resources that are historically and socially patterned in the process of constructing distinct and positive identities as Indian and as Navajo.

Cultural identities are the points of identification, the unstable points of identification or suture, which are made within the discourses of history and culture. Not an essence, but a positioning. Hence, there is always a politics of identity, a politics of position, which has no absolute guarantee in an unproblematic, transcendental 'law of origin.'

Foucault's use of Freud is ambiguous: sometimes he uses him for purely instrumental purposes (when reconstructing the history of madness and sexuality), but sometimes—for anthropological purposes signaling Freud's role in redefining our common humanity and particularly our relation to language, life and work. The author confronts Foucault's ambiguous reading of Freud with the equally ambiguous reading of Foucault by Derrida. Derrida discusses Foucault twice. Once in the essay Cogito and The History of Madness in which Derrida takes on Foucault's understanding of Descartes and his role in the exclusion of madness from the realm of reason.

Although numerous studies examine the relationship between class, cultural capital and academic outcomes, and some focus on gender differences in cultural capital, few attempt to operationalize Bourdieu's accompanying concepts of habitus and practice, and to consider gender differences along these dimensions. The present study addresses these gaps by examining a ""structure-disposition-practice"" model of the relationships between family socioeconomic status (SES), sex, habitus, academic practices, and academic achievement using multilevel Canadian data. Findings of SES and gender differences in the model offer qualified support for the potential of Bourdieu's framework to help increase our understanding of class and gender disparities in educational outcomes.

Drawing on analysis of in-depth interviews it finds four main ways in which religion informs processes of social identification and community construction in Northern Ireland: where it acts as an identity marker; where religious rituals play a practical role, or religious ideas play a symbolic role, in the construction of community; and, where doctrine can legitimize oppositional social identifications. In fact, specifically religious structures and religious ideas remain socially significant beyond the confines of the most devout.

Qualitative research in the history and sociology of science suggests that this choice is patterned by an ""essential tension"" between productive tradition and risky innovation. We examine this tension through Bourdieu's field theory of science, and we explore it empirically by analyzing millions of biomedical abstracts from MEDLINE. We represent the evolving state of chemical knowledge with networks extracted from these abstracts. We then develop a typology of research strategies on these networks. Scientists can introduce novel chemicals and chemical relationships (innovation) or delve deeper into known ones (tradition). They can consolidate knowledge clusters or bridge them. The aggregate distribution of published strategies remains remarkably stable. High-risk innovation strategies are rare and reflect a growing focus on established knowledge. An innovative publication is more likely to achieve high impact than a conservative one, but the additional reward does not compensate for the risk of failing to publish. By studying prizewinners in biomedicine and chemistry, we show that occasional gambles for extraordinary impact are a compelling explanation for observed levels of risky innovation.

Using qualitative interviews with Norwegian exporters and Danish importers, this article examines transactions in the international fish trade. We find that the assumed episodic and highly competitive commodity trade is rooted in dyadic networks and personal trust; inspired by the work of Goffman, we analyse transaction patterns as 'interaction order'. The transaction pattern is dependent on a particular organization of social interaction, interaction in which business dealings are divided into delimited spheres of the 'formal', 'personal' and 'private'. This division reflects a differentiation of the social roles, one in which traders avoid the role conflicts inherent in close relationships.

Activities that deviate from these values derive from the cognitive expectations inner-city blacks have formed in the face of their restricted legitimate opportunity structures. These expectations, which suggest that educational and occupational success are improbable for inner-city residents, are accurate. If their opportunities were to improve, their cognitive expectations would change and most would be committed to taking advantage of these new opportunities. The differences that separate the inner-city poor from whites center on cultural symbols, which help constitute their identity, sometimes in opposition to the white majority. Most deficiencies in performance among blacks stem not from these cultural attributes, but from the way they are processed in white-dominated organizations.

Methods. Using the Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group Files from 1983-1990, a natural experiment framework is developed to assess the differential wage impact of employer sanctions on Latino ethnic subgroups.

Results of studies comparing employed women, employed men, and housewives have been mixed, however, and investigators have begun to consider additional explanatory factors. This paper focuses on a potential source of gender differences in distress that has received relatively little attention: the workplace itself. I consider the extent to which work conditions and the sexual segregation of occupations are related to two measures of distress: demoralization, which is more prevalent among women, and drinking, which is more prevalent among men. Multiple regression analyses indicate that the only work-related factors associated with demoralization are substantive complexity and full-time work, and these have an effect among women only. Full-time work and low levels of complexity are associated with higher levels of demoralization among women. Substantive complexity is also associated with drinking, but only among men; as complexity declines, levels of drinking increase.

Does the difference between White and non-White county mortality still favor White counties, and will a racial differential favoring White-designated counties exist when residency status is held constant and when areal social class characteristics are held constant? All counties of the 12-state North Central Region (N = 1056) provide the data. T-test, covariance, and multiple classification analyses are used to investigate the questions. Metropolitan and White counties (with age controlled) displayed lower crude death rates. The latter two questions were answered strongly in the affirmative, indicating, not only that significant residency and racial differences in county mortality exist, but also that, even when controlled for residency status and areal social class, the racial differential persists. Conclusions support the use and conceptualization of mortality as an indicator of inequality. Discussion centers around the persistent racial differential and draws tentatively upon a ""theory of insecurity"" or ""minority group status"" hypothesis for explanation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20831105,1979,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20831105,0.513912201,1,0,0.447837174,14,0,0.544824004,66,0
0,0,0,Marital Homogamy the Second Time around," Recent declines in the marriage rate and increases in the prevalence of remarriage point to the need for more careful analysis of the nature of second marriage. Very few sound empirical data are available concerning the mate selection or adjustment processes of second marriages, and this hampers the development of useful, generalized knowledge about remarriage. Utilizing data from the 1970 National Fertility Survey, this paper compares the levels of marital homogamy—in age, education and religious identification—of women in their first marriages and women in their second marriages, as well as in the previous marriages of the twice-wed women. The analysis shows that twice-wed women experience low homogamy in both their current and first marriages. The persistence of this pattern through the application of controls for status, age, and religiosity indicates that the differences do not result primarily from marriage market constraints. Though several caveats are noted, the results support the perspective that some women, either because of their conception of marriage, or because of their mate selection pattern, are disproportionately prone to divorce and remarry. The implications of these findings for divorce trends are discussed.

There has been little effort to integrate the study of the marriage effect on men's wages with the literature on the division of labor in the household or to understand behavioral processes that link marital status to men's wages. This study addresses both oversights. Three dominant perspectives on the allocation of household responsibilities suggest that married couples are likely to assign more income-earning responsibility to the husband. These perspectives can be extended to predict that married men set higher earnings goals than single men. Married men are likely to be more attentive to opportunities to increase their earnings and to risks that could reduce their earnings. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this study focuses on men's job-shift processes. Findings indicate that married men are more likely than single men to pursue job-shift patterns that result in greater wage gains and to avoid those that result in lower wage gains and that a portion of the marriage differential in men's wages is attributable to job-shift processes.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/353887,1999,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_353887,0.492547572,3,0,0.48751986,34,0,0.41417101,5,0

For the sample as a whole, support was found for a social selection process, since psychological distress predicted decreases in primary, but not secondary, social relationships. The extent of primary relationships also were found to be associated with subsequent distress, providing evidence that the relationship between mental health and social environment may be transactional.

This limitation forces a reliance on subjective measures that typically contain both systematic and random measurement errors. Systematic errors, or ""biases,"" are the focus of this paper. Campbell and Fiske's (1959) multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) research design is the best known social scientific procedure for uncovering systematic errors, but the data requirements for classical MTMM designs are too demanding for many areas of sociology in which secondary data are the norm. We show that the benefits of the MTMM design are available under more relaxed conditions. In addition, we illustrate how researchers can examine the determinants of systematic errors and gain insights into the potential for confounding or spurious effects caused by systematic errors. We demonstrate the usefulness of these methods using the subjective measures of liberal democracy used in several recent ASR papers and provide additional examples, including measures of the reputational quality of graduate programs and job evaluations for comparable-worth investigations.

The average age of the respondents was 68, with a range running from 55 to 96 years, and 64% were women. Responses to the SF-36 questionnaire indicated that for male respondents aged 55-64, the mean score for the 8 dimensions was 76.1. This mean was a bit higher than the 74.4 mean of 1999. For male respondents aged 65 and older the mean was 69.0, which was also higher than the 68.3 mean of 1999. For females aged 55-64, the mean score for 8 dimensions was 73.1, versus 73.0 in 1999. For female respondents aged 65 and older, the mean score was 67.0, versus 65.4 in 1999. Based on these mean scores for the 8 dimensions, then, it is fair to say that the overall health status of males and females aged 55 years and older in the region in 2005 was at least as good as (i.e., the same as or better than) that in 1999. Comparing 28 average figures for the 2005 respondents on satisfaction with specific domains of life (e.g., financial security, health, sense of meaning) and three global indicators (satisfaction with life as a whole and with the overall quality of life, and happiness) with those of the 1999 respondents, we found that the scores for the 2005 sample were at least as high as those of the other sample. Thus, it seems fair to say that the perceived quality of life of older people in the former NIHR so far as it is revealed in domain and global satisfaction and happiness scores, is at least as good as the perceived quality of life of a similar sample in 1999. Although a large majority perceived increases in crime in the 2 year periods prior to both surveys, smaller percentages of the 2005 sample than of the 1999 sample thought that crime had increased over the past two years, avoided going out at night, feared for their safety, had crime-related worries, engaged in crime-related defensive behaviours and were actually the victims of any crimes. Therefore, it seems fair to say that, so far as crime-related issues are concerned for the two samples of seniors responding to our surveys, there is more evidence of improvement than of deterioration. Applying stepwise multiple regression, each of the eight dependent variables was explained on the basis of four clusters of predictors separately and then a final regression was run using only the statistically significant predictors from the four clusters. Broadly speaking, 7 SF-36 health status scales explained from 28% to 45% of the variance in the 8 dependent variables, running from satisfaction with the overall quality of life (28%) to the single item measure of general health (45%). The seven predictors in the Social Relations cluster explained from 7% of the variance in the SF-36 General Health scale scores to 57% of the variance in the Life Satisfaction scores. The four predictors in the Problems cluster explained from 10% of the variance in the SF-36 General Health scale scores to 24% of the variance in the SWLS scores. The 11 predictors in the Domain Satisfaction cluster explained from 14% of the variance in the SF-36 General Health scale scores to 64% of the variance in the SWB scores. Putting all the significant predictors together for each dependent variable, in the weakest case, 4 of 11 potential predictors explained 33% of the variance in the SF-36 General Health scale scores and in the strongest case, 9 of 15 potential predictors explained 70% of the variance in Life Satisfaction scores. Among other things, these results clearly show that respondents' ideas about a generally healthy life are different from, but not independent of, their ideas about a happy, satisfying or contented life, or about the perceived quality of their lives or their subjective wellbeing. Finally, the 7 core discrepancy predictors of MDT plus incomes were used to explain the eight dependent variables. From 13% of the variance in the SF-36 General Health scale scores to 57% of the variance in SWLS scores was explained using those predictors. Based on an examination of the Total Effects scores for the predictors of the 8 dependent variables, the most influential predictors were Self-Wants, followed by Self-Others and then Self-Best. In other words, the most influential discrepancy predictors of respondents' overall life assessments were those between what respondents have versus what they want, followed by what they have versus what others of the same age and sex have, and then by what they have versus the best they ever had in the past.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20734512,2007,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_20734512,0.430233657,0,0,0.427867621,58,0,0.436036319,6,0

In the planning of Tumbler Ridge, a new coal mining town in British Columbia, ""socially responsive planning"" was an attempt to develop a town using principles derived from social science research. In this paper the reactions of residents to selected attributes which reflect the application of these principles are examined five years after settlement began. Ratings of community attributes offer an indication of aspects of residential satisfaction, while the results of a principal components analysis suggest the dimensionality of residents' evaluative structures and provide a useful framework within which to consider planning issues. Issues examined are: the association between employment and the community environment; the suitability of the environment for children; and the social environment. While social aspects of the new community are judged as satisfactory, less positive elements reflect the underlying influence of the economic well-being of the mining company on overall community satisfaction. When compared to indicators of community satisfaction in other western Canadian resource towns, ratings for Tumbler Ridge tend to be fairly low. It is concluded that the inability of planners to adequately control implementation or continuity of their ideas has resulted in a community not distinctly different from other resource towns.

Structural factors consistent with anonymity -- i.e., increasing population density, political and economic differentiation, and monetary exchange -- are hypothesized to influence the universalization of ritual occasions. A recursive path model is devised for the hypothesized relationships in the universalization process. We find support for the model using data from a cross-cultural sample of nonindustrial societies.

Postulating that informal gatherings with family and friends might be a functional alternative to associational life, we employed multiple regression analysis to test the hypothesis. The analysis was based on a 2011 territory-wide door-to-door survey in Hong Kong. Controlling for the effects of demographic variables including gender, age, educational level, and employment status, it was found that formal participation in organizations contributed significantly to the explanation in five of the eight subindexes of social cohesion. In contrast, informal connections contributed significantly only to one subindex. The pattern persisted when attitudinal variables such as life satisfaction, social support, and perceived social class were added to the regression analysis. In short, our analysis demonstrated that participation in formal organizations fosters various aspects of social cohesion, and that this effect cannot be replaced by informal gatherings with family and friends.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24721456,2014,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_24721456,0.7067874074,10,0,0.7092547417,49,0,0.6033596992,5,0

Each of these components of the practice of eating is examined for indications of whether there are any tendencies towards de-differentiation within countries or convergence across countries. There are some common patterns across countries, notably a decline in the amount of time devoted to food preparation. Time spent on eating at home reduces in all countries except France. In the USA, time devoted to domestic food preparation and consumption is minimal. Internal differentiation shows continuities -- of gender divisions and age-related behavior -- but also new emergent tendencies -- with the presence of children and levels of cultural capital becoming significant predictors of behaviour.

It asks why the traditional Incarnation feast has been overwhelmed by intense commercial cooptation and economic rationalization. In pursuit of some of the roots of this institutionalized activity an effort is made to grasp the place of economic surplus (those goods left over after basic subsistence needs have been cared for) in human society. Religious control and direction of surplus, sacredly interpreted, produced a complex of ethical postulates aimed at development of restraints on practices considered as self-aggrandizing in a material way. Pre-Christian and Christian practices up to the Reformation seem to be as one on this issue. The Reformation and movements which arose in conjunction with it seem to have revised this ancient system of material restraint. Modern Christmas appears to be a manifestation of a new complex of attitudes regarding use of economic surplus. Gift-giving is central and conjecturally considered as a phenomenon which reveals some of the meaning of this national period of festivity; festivity aimed at honoring the productiveness of the American economic system. There is also an attempt made to judge the power of the 'work ethic' as a fundamental construct involved in the processes of the American culture's magnification of Christmas as its greatest moment of prodigal exuberance.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23261799,1977,Humboldt Journal of Social Relations,10.2307_23261799,0.6986588836,13,0,0.5809266567,23,0,0.5543317199,3,0

Using in-depth interviews with 61 students, I ask: How does social class structure students' participation in the collegiate extra-curriculum? I argue that the collegiate extra-curriculum is an important site for stratification because it is there that students gain access to social and cultural resources valued by the privileged classes. I find that upper-middle-class students arrive on campus with cultural resources that motivate their participation and social resources that facilitate their involvement. Among working-class students, limited financial factors constrain their involvement, while social and cultural resources further curtail their interest in such activities. These findings contribute to theories of social and cultural reproduction by showing that those who have more valued social and cultural resources at the outset are in a better position to gain additional such resources throughout their college careers.

First, I introduce the 'racialized modernity' thesis and suggest that notions of race and racialization are neither adequate nor appropriate categories to apply to the reification of modernity in the USSR. I then turn to western views of Russia, emphasizing the role accorded to Russians of the 'not quite European' Europeans. These two sections provide the background to a discussion of the development of an ethnopolitical form of communist modernity — a form in which the proletariat was simultaneously an ethnic and political category — which is introduced in the rest of the article. Section six is somewhat different, charting the abandonment of the communist vision. The so-called 'return to Europe', although a supposedly stalled and certainly an ambiguous process, is presented here in terms of the reanimation of western and Russian myths of communism as a non-European 'hiatus' in Russian history.

I analyze the links between offenders' accounts of past negative behavior, their construction of their possible ""clean"" future selves, and the social and structural conditions in which they were raised and continue to be embedded. Applying Scott and Lyman's (1968) framework on accounts and Markus and Nurius's (1986) framework of possible selves to interview data with twenty-eight criminal offenders, I illustrate how excuses for past behavior provide a way for people to distance themselves from their past selves in attempts to preserve or re-create a possible self that is still worthy to be redeemed in the future. This discourse becomes one mechanism that motivates individuals to change their lives—but it can be short-lived. The analysis highlights how limited structural opportunities influence individuals' lifestyles and behaviors, how individuals approach the desistance process even in the face of structural deprivation, and how they attempt to sustain this desistance process.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/si.2011.34.1.63,2011,Symbolic Interaction,10.1525_si.2011.34.1.63,0.7077301145,32,0,0.6493088603,10,0,0.5993795395,5,0
0,0,0,Consumption Caught in the 'Cash Nexus',"During the last thirty years 'consumption' has become a major topic in the study of contemporary culture within anthropology, psychology and sociology. For many authors it has become central to understanding the nature of material culture in the modern world, but this paper argues that the concept is, in British writing at least, too concerned with its economic origins in the selling and buying of consumer goods or commodities. It is argued that to understand material culture as determined through the monetary exchange for things - the cash nexus - leads to an inadequate sociological understanding of the social relations with objects. The work of Jean Baudrillard is used both to critique the concept of consumption as it leads to a focus on advertising, choice, money and shopping and to point to a more sociologically adequate approach to material culture that explores objects in a system of models and series, 'atmosphere', functionality, biography, interaction and mediation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42856225,2000,Sociology,10.2307_42856225,0.7069332004,15,0,0.6310071349,12,0,0.5742974281,1,0

It demonstrates how prosecutors use discordant locales to justify case rejection. By ascribing stereotypical characteristics of a neighborhood to victims, defendants, and jurors, prosecutors construct distinct groups with different cultures who live in geographically separate spaces and have different schemes through which they interpret the everyday world. To construct discordant locale categorizations, prosecutors employ race, class, and gender imagery. Through this imagery they construct multiple normative standards of moral character of persons and of places.

A content analysis of twelve interviews with arthritis sufferers shows that, in addition to the practical and emotional challenges of living with arthritis, these actors face the daily challenge of displaying their understanding of embodied fluidity—the timely and fluid movement through time and space—as a virtuous practice. Our informants use the movement mandate—the commitment to move despite the pain it may cause—to produce themselves as competent social and moral actors sacrificing the demands of their bodies to meet social expectations, and they conduct this performance in front of several audiences: the self and specific and generalized others. For these informants, in both private and public realms, the experience and the management of pain and physical limitation are profoundly social and accountable matters, as they affect interactions with others, their own social identities and moral integrity, and their relations with self as they seek to balance their arthritis pain with their past, present, and future self-concepts.

In developing such a firm, there are certain minimum requirements that obviously must be met from the outset: for instance, the acquisition of an office as well as certain types of hardware and office equipment is a necessity. In addition, developing such an organization means hiring professional and administrative staff who will support the work. A second aspect which is of critical importance -- and also a pre-requisite to obtaining work -- is establishing credibility. This assures prospective clients that the service which the organization provides is of the highest professional quality. Learning how to deal with clients, however, is a key to obtaining work — the third element of critical importance. Indeed, when writing proposals in response to RFP's issued by government agencies, there are specific guidelines that, if followed, may increase the chances of getting a particular job -- whether this job is at the federal, state, or local level.

Qualitative content analysis is used to analyze the decisions. Results. The study found that despite organizational reforms, local offices had created the welfare-to-work version of an eligibility-compliance culture, where sanctions were based primarily on attendance records and became a paper-processing function.

Because the sets of activities required by the projects are not mutually exclusive, we cannot apportion an activity's fixed cost or resource consumption to a single project.

The effectiveness of these forms is dependent on the composition and experience of the team, their interpretation of the situation at hand, and their ability to formulate a timely response. However, competing demands from the team member's organizational affiliation and the specific needs of the crisis both influence response decision-making priorities and choices.

The article aims to compensate for some of the analytic problems existing in each perspective related to public administration. An approach is proposed that assumes the complex nature of public administration and tries to overcome the shortcomings of the democratic governance school, which focuses solely on variations in the attitudes of the subjects and not so much on their object (administrative institutions and outputs). It also seeks to avoid some of the methodological pitfalls in studies focusing too narrowly on the performance of particular public organizations. Using the case of Spain to apply the concepts of process and structure congruence, the article shows how citizens' attitudes toward public administration are primarily influenced by political culture, specific public activities, and institutional design.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3381309,2003,Public Performance & Management Review,10.2307_3381309,0.7377896309,20,0,0.6827483773,5,0,0.6161238551,8,0

The subject of this article is how changes in the nature of the company and in the nature of the employment relationship affect the type of rules regulating the utilization of labour. Starting point of our analysis is that in both the company and the employment relation, market pressures are increasing. For the company this implies that the borderline between the organisation and its environment is becoming fluid and for the employment relation it implies that elements of market relations are on the increase. In the classic company the model of wage labour under a standard labour contract still dominates, while in the modern network/virtual company contracts for services is becoming a dominant way of utilization of labour. Between these two models many hybrid employment relations are developing, combining elements of both. The hybridisation of the employment relation poses several problems for HRM policy. In this article three new instruments for the management of hybrid employment relations are assessed: • competency based appraisal systems; • intensification of the dialogue between employee and supervisor; • individual choice benefits systems. • competency based appraisal systems; • intensification of the dialogue between employee and supervisor; • individual choice benefits systems.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41783480,2004,Management Revue,10.2307_41783480,0.7271629572,11,0,0.7502705455,48,0,0.6444014311,1,0

Increasingly, there is a growing mandate among all sectors of society—public, governmental, business, civic, and environmental—to become collaborative stakeholders in dialogues about the management of ecosystem resources. What has been missing, however, is an explicit analysis of interorganizational networks for sustainable ecosystem management as emerging learning organizations.

The Tailoring of Legitimating Accounts and the Social Construction of Identity,"We empirically explore the legitimating accounts for and against policies precluding workplace discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people, focusing on how agents working at both the national level and within organizations use broader cultural accounts in building their legitimating accounts in local settings. The diffusion perspective in institutional theory has portrayed how agents import ""ready-to-wear"" cultural accounts. In contrast, translation theory depicts how agents interpret and adapt cultural accounts as they fashion them into legitimating accounts for a local setting. An alternative would theorize accounts that are neither strictly borrowed nor idiosyncratically tailored. We advanced a third perspective, drawing on frame analysis as it is used in social movement theory. Framing theory attends to both the importance of cultural building blocks and the embedded ways in which agents relate to and shape systems of meaning and mobilize collective action to change social arrangements. We find that legitimating accounts are intertwined with the construction of social identities, which serve to legitimate, on the one hand, an account maker's participation in the discourse and set of claims, and on the other hand, the involvement of proponents and crucial audiences. We suggest that the mobilizing potential of legitimating accounts rests in part on their messages becoming ""autocommunicational,"" so that listeners identify themselves with the message.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3086073,1998,Organization Science,10.2307_3086073,0.8145365715,222,2,0.6799768209,16,0,0.6261644363,22,0

Results indicate that directors having leadership roles show higher levels of continuance commitment, affective commitment and better performance than directors who have not served in a leadership role. Greater tenure on the board not only has a positive effect on affective commitment, but also on self-reported performance.

1,0,0,Comparative Cause Mapping of Organizational Cognitions,"Increasingly, thoughtful managers recognize the role of knowledge and learning in corporate action and performance. Concurrently, a new field, management and organization cognition (MOC), has emerged producing useful insights and findings. Thus far, empirical studies have largely focused on single cases or actors, using often archival data and sometimes ambiguous methods. To advance the field will require pragmatic tools for eliciting data on thinking in real organizations and for conducting rigorous and more comparative studies of management and organization cognitions. This paper describes a method for comparatively studying real-life managerial thinking, defined here as the respective manager's beliefs about key phenomena and their efficacy links in their strategic and operative situation. The applicability of such a definition will depend on the requirements of research at hand. The payoff is that, thus defined, key elements in managerial and organizational cognitions can be usefully captured by cognitive mapping, an established approach in MOC research. The approach contains, first, a method for eliciting comparison-enabling interview data of several subjects. Then, using researcher-based, interpretive standardization of the individual natural discourses, databases of standard concepts and causal links, constituting the cause map elements, are distilled. This facilitates a text-oriented description of the thinking patterns of single actors like managers or organizational groups, which can be used in traditional-type mapping studies, which typically assume unitary or quasi-unitary actors. However, the method is intended for comparative analyses, e.g., for pinpointing the cognitive differences or similarities across organizational actors or for constructing and comparing groups, assumed cognitively homogenous. Also, it is applicable for longitudinal studies or aggregated, e.g., industry-level, descriptions of MOC. A PC application is available for the technique, although many of the processing tasks are amenable to general-purpose relational database software. The paper presents a study case comparing the cognitive structures of managers in two interrelated industries in terms of their concept bases and causal beliefs. The objective was to understand the substance of management thinking, as well as the formative logic behind how managers come to think in the shared ways. It is shown that patterns of industry-typical core causal thinking, manifestations of a dominant logic or recipe, can be located, operationalized and comparatively analyzed with this method. Substantively, the contents of management thinking are typically products of complex long-term mechanisms. These consist, first, of organizational problem-solving, recurrently facing a specific, adequately stable constellation of strategic tasks and environment elements, similar within industries and systematically different across them, and, second, of various social processes, which directly transfer and influence management thinking. The paper concludes with discussing the cause mapping method and suggests some options for further studies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635134,1991,Organization Science,10.2307_2635134,0.7007451057,11,1,0.6949296594,26,0,0.6278697848,7,0
0,0.5,0,Comparing the Resource-Based and Market-Based Views of the Firm: Empirical Evidence from Czech Privatization,"The recent privatization of state-owned enterprises in the Czech Republic forms a natural experiment to test and compare the predictive ability of the resource-based view (RBV) against the market-based view (MBV) under conditions of great change. It has been recognized in the literature that, under normal stable circumstances, a firm's internal resources and its external market power are fundamentally intertwined. Consequently, it is difficult to identify the relative roles of these two theories in explaining expected firm performance and firm value. However, when market conditions are in a state of flux, as in the case of the Czech Republic in 1992, we expect the firm's resources to be the primary determinants of firm value. In order to test this notion, an RBV model was developed, based on a set of firm features reflecting the rare and valuable ability to compete in the emerging capitalistic economy (as opposed to the currently prevailing bureaucratically planned economy). A contrasting MBV model was also developed, highlighting the role of market power in this regard. These models were assessed in a cross-sectional sample of 988 Czech firms undergoing privatization. The empirical findings show that the RBV-driven variables are remarkably better at explaining share values of Czech firms in the period of privatization than MBV-driven variables. These results underscore the role of firm resources as a primary determinant of firm value in rapidly changing environments.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20060545,2003,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_20060545,0.6996003389,12,0,0.7295947671,59,0,0.6955361366,13,0

A questionnaire-based scenario study conducted on 530 management conference presenters supported the hypothesis that the decision to share a conference paper is both a calculative and normative choice. Analysis demonstrated that academicians calculate the benefits and costs of sharing within the context of dyadic exchanges, but they also follow the social norms of sharing, thereby recognizing the context of generalized exchange. In particular, academicians have more intent to share when they perceive the more general benefits of sharing and the stronger social norms of the academic community that encourage sharing. They have less intent to share when the paper type is conceptual. A subsequent examination of actual sharing behavior for two of the four initial experimental conditions generally supported our findings.

Our focus is the ""sector knowledge"" that consultants accumulate which derives from repeated assignments in the industrial sector in which the client organization resides. This has been under-researched partly because of an emphasis on knowledge as technique and method. But knowledge configured around the sector enables consultants to play the role of the outside expert and draw on a language and experiences held in common with the client. The paper explores the role of consultants as sector intermediaries through a case study of contemporary management consulting in a UK local authority.

There is a growing literature on international human resource management targeted at people studying management in large organizations which has encouraged an element of cultural sensitivity in HR practices. This paper is concerned with demonstrating how the capability approach can help link the world of work to wider socio-economic and citizenship development. Human exploitation (more negative) and raising returns to human capital (more positive) are compared to the capability approach as models for understanding the impact of human resource management activities. For the Capability Approach, it is important to take into account the potential impact of HRD on people working for a TNC and on their wider well-being outside the TNC. A case study of TNCs in Ghana is used to explore how the capability approach can be applied in practice.

Industrial field salespeople are likely to encounter ethical conflicts on a daily basis in their dealings with customers, competitors, and their own management. How they resolve such conflicts is believed to be a function of both individual characteristics and factors in the situation. This study focuses on situational factors in the form of organization design variables, particularly control system and task environment. The firm's control system includes its method of monitoring, supervising and compensating salespeople. The study develops fourteen ethics-related selling scenarios and assesses, via projective questioning, how 446 salespeople would react to them. Findings indicate that organization design does influence the behavior a salesperson considers appropriate to cope with ethical conflicts. In particular, salespeople operating under a more bureaucratic, input-based control system advocate more ethical behavior than do salespeople operating under a more output-based, laissez-faire control system. Also, salespeople who perceive the market to be competitive recommend less ethical behavior. However, the proportion of salary versus commission in the salesperson's compensation system does not have an effect on response. Differences are also discovered with respect to the salesperson's seniority, rank, and certain features of the task environment.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635083,1988,Organization Science,10.2307_2635083,0.7259364724,18,0,0.7149243951,110,0,0.6205737591,13,0

At the same time, a much larger number of firms escape the various costs associated with litigation by adhering to the provisions of the same laws and regulations. It is not a priori apparent why this dichotomy exists. In this paper we draw on corporate governance and stakeholder theories to empirically investigate environmental lawsuits. Specifically, we compare the pre-lawsuit profile of 209 violators to a sample of matched control firms between 1994 and 1998. We find that the likelihood of becoming a lawsuit defendant increases with board size, with the fraction of directors in industrial firms, and with the fraction of inside ownership, and decreases with the number of directorships held by outside directors. These findings are robust to alternative dependent variable specifications. Together, our results suggest that managers, researchers, and policy-makers need to direct their attention to the corporate board as the core decision-making unit forming corporate environmental policies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094474,1989,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_3094474,0.709407568,4,0,0.7496052384,69,0,0.6765280962,5,0

This paper analyzes and compares the code contents of seven Eastern European countries with respect to generally accepted best practice recommendations on disclosure rules, strengthening shareholder rights and modernising boards. We show that for some countries the contents of the country codes are actually rather different as compared to these best practices, suggesting that domestic forces related to country-specific characteristics of corporate governance systems may have helped shaping the contents of corporate governance codes.

A transformational program presupposes a change in behavior of the attending executive so that the latter becomes more effective in personal or organizational change. To understand what influences the transformational process three triangular conceptual frameworks (building on the short-term dynamic psychotherapy tradition) are presented: the mental life triangle, the conflict triangle, and the relationships triangle. The first shows that cognitive and emotional processes need to be taken into consideration to create changes in behavior. The second describes the sources of thoughts and feelings that may prompt anxiety and cause defensive reactions prohibiting change and productive use of talents. The third relationships triangle explains how an individual's previous experiences create patterns of response that are repeated throughout life and can become dysfunctional. Five major challenges in program design are also examined: selecting participants; identifying the focal issue on which participants need to work; the creation of a safe transitional space that enables the change process; using the group dynamic to foster transformation and to arrive at internalization of the change process; and the educational implications for faculty, facilitators, and coaches.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40214463,2007,Academy of Management Learning & Education,10.2307_40214463,0.709222734,10,0,0.6780054569,10,0,0.6116351485,4,0
