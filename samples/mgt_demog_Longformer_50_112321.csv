,,,German Reunification -Impacts on the Situation of Female Employees,"• The reunification of Germany in 1989 resulted in drastic socio-economic change, including a transformation of the economic structures and technologies of the new German Länder. This empirical analysis based on 66 interviews and a sociological longitudinal-section survey, looks into the status of female employees in enterprises in East Germany and how it has changed. The study covers three main areas: 1) jobs and job conditions, such as employment opportunities for female employees, job security and chances for further education; 2) the actual work environment, i. e. for instance assessment by colleagues and superiors; and 3) the female employee as such, which examines, e. g., professional and career orientation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40835732,MIR: Management International Review,10.2307_40835732,Management & Organizational Behavior,1999.0,0,2.4430548364762217e-05,0,0.00043581167119555175,1,0.978538453578949
,,,Toward a game theory of organizational ecology: production adjustment costs and managerial growth preferences,"This paper merges two theoretical perspectives in a mathematical game-theoretic modeling approach: industrial organization on the one hand, which basically is the economic theory of market competition and firm strategies, and organizational ecology on the other hand, which is a major sociological tradition that studies the evolution of organizational populations. The merger is instrumental in analyzing a key question in strategic organization: what is the role of flexibility, inertia and efficiency in facilitating firm performance in a selection environment, in terms of both profitability and survival? We argue particularly that game theory can offer a mathematical model of organizational ecology. In this paper we explore two modeling examples. The first model introduces production adjustment costs and the second managerial growth preferences in a Cournot duopoly game. Both models support organizational ecology's claim that an inert firm may push a flexible rival from the market. Moreover, four additional results are worth mentioning. First, a firm's profit-enhancing flexibility or inertia profile is contingent upon the market's carrying capacity development. Second, the inert firm may even outperform its flexible rival when the inert market leader faces a cost disadvantage. Third, this may happen in a munificent environment, implying that cut-throat rivalry can be the result of strategic competition only, as it is facilitated by organizational inertia. Fourth, in response to the rival's flexibility or inertia profile, a firm can calculate its profit-maximizing production adjustment cost or managerial growth objective strategy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23727420,Strategic Organization,10.2307_23727420,Management & Organizational Behavior,2003.0,0,5.4787975386716425e-05,0,0.00021741421369370073,1,0.9992096424102783
,,,Impacts of entrepreneurs' stress and family members on SMEs' business success in Serbian family-owned firms,"This paper focuses on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in Serbia, with a special emphasis on family-owned businesses. The main goal of this research is to analyze family business owners' perception of stress caused by high levels of responsibility and flexible working hours, as well as to analyze the influence of family member employees on the success of a company. This research has confirmed that high levels of responsibility and flexible working hours do not represent important factors for giving up on starting a business. Furthermore, owners perceive these two stressors as ""positive"" stress. The second important result of this study is that a large number of family member employees, and unclear hierarchy between them, can endanger a company's success in terms of annual income and annual turnover. Dieser Beitrag konzentriert sich auf kleinste, kleine und mittlere Unternehmen in Serbien, mit einem Fokus auf Familienunternehmen. Das Ziel dieser Studie ist die Analyse der Stresswahrnehmung des Eigentümers des Familienunternehmens, verursacht durch ein hohes Maß an Verantwortung und flexiblen Arbeitszeiten. Ebenso wird der Einfluss von mitarbeitenden Familienmitgliedern auf den Unternehmenserfolg untersucht. Diese Forschungsarbeit bestätigt, dass ein hohes Maß an Verantwortung und flexible Arbeitszeiten keine wichtigen Faktoren gegen die Unternehmensgründung sind. Darüber hinaus nehmen die Besitzer diese beiden Stressoren als ""positiven"" Stress wahr.

We summarize into four major areas the technological and social hazards to which health care workers are exposed: physical hazards and accidents, chemical or toxicological hazards, infectious diseases, and social hazards — including stress and sexual harassment. Further, we discuss the structural barriers which mitigate workers' perceptions of these risks and limit their ability to define their workplace as dangerous. Primary among these are the occupational hierarchy, including sex and race segregation, and the differential vulnerability related to that hierarchy.

Furthermore, we explored the role of gender combination in service encounters. We tested our hypotheses with a sample of 29 service employees and 345 service encounters.

Drawing from prior turnaround research, we identify several prominent forms of CEO fit/misfit that are especially germane to troubled firms. In testing our hypotheses, we find substantial support for the fit/refit theory: troubled companies have substantially better performance to the extent that they replace incumbents who are poorly suited to the conditions at hand and when they appoint new CEOs who are well matched to those conditions. Further reaffirming the fit/refit model, we find that CEO replacement per se has no general effect on the improvement of troubled firms.",external-fulltext-any,Organization Science,10.2307_41429028,Management & Organizational Behavior,,0,2.443003722873982e-05,0,0.0002545660245232284,1,0.9999134540557861

To address this gap, this paper examines common breakdowns in implementing four process models of organization change: teleology (planned change), life cycle (regulated change), dialectics (conflictive change), and evolution (competitive change). Change agents typically respond to these breakdowns by taking actions to correct people and organizational processes so they conform to their model of change.

,,,Different Forms of Agency and Institutional Influences within Multinational Enterprises,"Given their exposure to diverse institutional settings, decision making in multinational enterprises (MNE) is marked by inconsistencies and conflict. Within the comparative institutional analysis (CIA) literature, such inconsistencies are seen as a source of experimentation or innovation. By contrast, in the international business (IB) literature, institutions are primarily understood as constraints on MNE activity. The latter focuses on ' institutional effects' taking institutions as stable and determining of social agency. As a way of addressing this limitation, we aim to understand the conditions that enable actors to engage in strategic action despite institutional pressures towards statis. The research draws on systematic comparative case studies of two large MNEs in the chemical industry, headquartered in Germany and the UK, and operating in Italy, Germany, and Poland. It focuses on one example of agency, subsidiary efforts to change product formulations that are successfully developed by the headquarters. We demonstrate that agency within MNEs is influenced by a fit between MNE coordination structures shaped by home country institutions and host country institutions' demands for flexibility or collaboration. Institutional incompatibilities between home and host contexts are unlikely to trigger actors' reflective capacity to change if the actors cannot draw on supportive coordination structures in the MNE. This is not just an 'institutional distance' argument as is commonly understood in IB.

The article integrates research from comparative corporate governance and agency theory to identify and evaluate four fundamental assumptions underlying most theoretical arguments linking performance and dismissal: (1) CEOs are personally responsible for firm performance outcomes; (2) boards/owners have the power to dismiss CEOs; (3) firm performance measures are meaningful; and (4) suitable alternative candidates for the CEO role are available. The authors argue that CEO accountability will vary in line with the extent to which these assumptions are more or less valid from one country to the next. They provide robust evidence - across both marketbased and accounting-based measures - that CEOs are more likely to be dismissed following poor firm performance in countries where managerial discretion is high, where firm performance measures are more meaningful, and where the CEO labor market is more developed.

The aim was to elicit the women's view of their work lives over the past two decades. Flight attendants working in the 1960s entered with the expectation of a short-term job. From their accounts of personal development and from reviews of newspaper accounts, court cases and union documents, the influence of three major social movements became apparent. The Civil Rights Movement prompted flight attendants to challenge the legality of airline rules that prevented them from working past age 32. The Women's Movement reinforced the value and seriousness of women's commitment to a career and enabled flight attendants to challenge traditional notions of the incompatibility of occupation and family.

,,,A cognitive model of stock market reactions to multi-firm alliance announcements,"Previous studies of stock market reactions to alliance announcements assume that investors accurately detect and encode these public statements, evaluate them with stable, well-established perferences, and that the signalling value of an announcement is independent of the context in which it is conveyed. This article draws on behavioural decision theory to advance a cognitive model of stock market reactions to the announcement of complex, multi-firm alliances. The model predicts a U-shaped relationship between the diversity of partners comprising the alliance and abnormal stock market returns. An empirical analysis of multi-firm alliances announced in the US between 2000 and 2004 corroborates the model's prediction. Moreover, the study shows that a firm's size and analyst coverage moderate the relationship between its alliance partners' diversity and its abnormal returns. These findings suggest that attentional selection and subsequent encoding processes produce cognitive biases in the interpretation of announcements and the market moves towards greater efficiency for large or high-coverage firms. Managers should thus take the effect of the 'process of processing' into account when disclosing information to the investor community.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23728623,Strategic Organization,10.2307_23728623,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,0,2.6289008019375615e-05,0,0.00029648831696249545,1,0.5018752813339233

Parallels and differences","The article describes how the concepts - i.e. people's knowledge and attitude connected to the Russian and Czech words for profit have changed during the transformation after 1989. In the socialist period capitalist profit maximization is stereotypically damned whereas socialist profit remains rather an internal matter of the enterprises. In the 1990ies both the profits of particular enterprises and the general notion of profit become a public matter. In specialized and newspaper texts profit is endorsed as a motivation for people to work and the driving economic force. In Czech spoken discourse people are often skeptical towards the notion of profit. Der Artikel beschreibt, wie sich nach der ""Wende"" von 1989 die Konzepte - d.h. Wissen und Einstellungen - zum russischen bzw. tschechischen Wort für Gewinn verändert haben. In den Texten aus sozialistischer Zeit wird kapitalistischer Gewinn stereotyp verurteilt. Sozialistischer Gewinn ist meistens eine interne Angelegenheit der Betriebe und nur eine von mehreren Kennziffern. In den 1990ern wird Gewinn zu einer Sache, die alle angeht: Er wird als wichtigstes Betriebsergebnis veröffentlicht; der Begriff wird eingehend diskutiert.

,,,Economic perspectives on tourism in China,"This paper employs input-output analysis to evaluate the economic aspects of tourism in China. It concludes that, given the size and diversity of the Chinese economy, tourism has provided only a limited stimulus to economic development at the national level. Tourism development depends markedly on input from secondary industry. Tourism contributes to direct value added for tourism commodities and generates substantial indirect and induced employment to non-tourism commodities, especially in agriculture. Leakage is rather low. Only 40 per cent of the tourism leakage comes directly from tourism-related commodities and more than half is indirect leakage from nontourism commodities, especially secondary industry. This suggests that the availability of secondary commodities may be a constraint on tourism development in China.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23747292,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23747292,Management & Organizational Behavior,2002.0,0,9.334667993243784e-06,1,0.7273834943771362,0,0.0003512570692691952

,,,Accounting Information Systems and Industrial Relations,"The trend toward greater participation among the ""social partners"" in industry, has made considerable progress in recent years, especially in Western Europe. Yet the contemporary accounting information system still reflects conditions when all attention is directed toward the contributors of capital while the ""social partners"" are classified as mere expense items. The paper discusses possibilities to deal with this conflicting situation and to emphasize the participation concept as part of the accounting system. Indeed, some attempts in this direction have already been made, such as consideration of human activities and social contributions of organizations. Much remains to be done; but here is a field worth intensive future studies. /// C'est particulièrement en Europe occidentale que la tendance vers une participation des ""partenaires sociaux"" s'est considérablement développée ces dernières années.

This study provides numerical estimates that help to answer this question, and also provides new information regarding the job responsibilities and positions in the executive hierarchy of women and men below the rank of CEO. This article presents the results of an extensive data collection effort that has yielded a comprehensive census of top executives in U.S. Fortune 1000 firms as of the year 2000. With regard to the pipeline to the CEO position, our data suggest that we should expect to see a slow increase in the percentage of CEOs that are women in the next five to ten years. Nevertheless, the percentage of CEOs that are women is likely to remain relatively low. As a result, our estimates suggest that if current trends continue, perhaps 6 percent of CEOs in the Fortune 1000 will be women by 2016.

Second, a model of personal ties and work satisfaction was postulated that allowed effects to vary across national origin categories. Consistent with a view that the Japanese favor vertical social structures, vertical differentiation of the organization's structure had positive effects on the personal ties and work satisfaction of the Japanese and Japanese-Americans but had no effects on the non-Japanese Americans. Furthermore, horizontal differentiation had negative effects on personal ties and work satisfaction for Japanese and Japanese-American workers but had no effect on these variables for non-Japanese Americans.

Inertial forces also caused Intel's corporate strategy to diverge from strategic actions taken by middle-level managers.

,,,Chefs and occupational culture in a hotel chain: A grid-group analysis,"A fierce recession in the UK between 1991 and 1995 led the hotel group Forte, like most companies, to initiate urgent turnaround and survival policies. This paper reports on a study of chefs' behaviour within Forte Crest Hotels, London, the strain placed on their occupation during this recession and the aftermath of Forte's levered corporate change policies in 1994—95. The enquiry was carried out before the hostile take-over of Forte by Granada in January 1996. Using grid-group analysis, a qualitative study based on structured interviews was undertaken. These interviews were analysed for commonalities and differences within a grid-group analysis framework, which addresses organisational, individual and group behavioural phenomena in a given social context. The findings reveal behavioural insights into the occupational identity of chefs and the allegiance they give to their occupation when faced with a programme of radical change initiated by management.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23746718,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23746718,Management & Organizational Behavior,2001.0,1,0.9991713762283325,0,0.00022952837753109634,1,0.8172746896743774
,,,"Reducing Control Loss in Organizations: The Implications of Dual Hierarchies, Mentoring and Strengthening Vertical Dyadic Linkages","Using Williamson's (1971) control loss model, the relative merits of dual hierarchies (P. B. Evans 1975), strong vertical dyadic linkages, and mentoring for reducing overall control loss are explored. The potential impact for each organizational structure or process is assessed. Simulations are performed to examine the impact of each of these organizational arrangements for organizations with hierarchical levels ranging from 3 to 11 levels. In addition, the effects of deteriorating control at each level are investigated. In the discussion of appropriate control strategies, a number of other organizational characteristics are discussed. I conclude that: 1. Under conditions of sequential or reciprocal interdependence, building uniformly high control efficiency throughout the organization is essential. 2. In small organizations (and those with high turnover) dual hierarchies and cadre relations are appropriate mechanisms for reducing control loss. 3. In large organizations (and those with low turnover) mentoring and cadres are appropriate.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631815,Management Science,10.2307_2631815,Management & Organizational Behavior,1984.0,0,1.0337037565477658e-05,0,0.00013343985483516008,1,0.978101909160614

Data were obtained from a randomly drawn community sample of 631 employed adults (278 men; 353 women). Respondents reported that work interfered with family life (W → F conflict) more frequently than family life interfered with work (F → W conflict). These results suggest that work and family boundaries are indeed asymmetrically permeable with family boundaries being more permeable than work boundaries. However, there was no evidence of gender differences in the pattern of asymmetry, indicating that the dynamics of work and family boundaries may operate similarly among men and women.

,,,Sex Segregation of Work in Finland and the Quality of Women's Work,The Finnish labor market is sharply segregated by sex. This is a statistically well-documented fact and holds true for all Western European market economies. The aim of this article was to find out whether women profit (regarding the quality of their work) from performing the same sort of work as men. The qualitative aspects of work were the following: autonomy at work; lack of routinization of work; the compulsory rhythm of work; and the demands for social skills. We also analyzed monthly pay and its variation according to functional segregation of work. The empirical data came from the Finnish Study on Working Conditions (1984) which is a representative sample of the Finnish wage-earning population with 4502 persons of whom 48 per cent were women and 52 per cent men. Our results indicate that women often profit from the fact that they perform the same sort of work as men. This profit was more apparent for white-collar than for blue-collar women. For men the effects of segregation on job characteristics were the opposite. They often profit from sex segregated work.

Innovations are difficult to interpret using existing schemata, causing organizations to search for information on the opportunities and threats implicit in observed innovations. Such search may lead to mimetic adoption of the innovation or, more likely, to more varied nonmimetic change. Results show an effect of innovations on the rate of nonmimetic change in radio markets, with innovations in large or nearby markets having greater effect and innovations by large organizations having less effect. The social and competitive relations of the innovator to a given organization are thus modifiers of the catalytic effect.

,,,Simplifying the Choice between Uncertain Prospects Where Preference Is Nonlinear," This work makes analytical progress in reducing or avoiding two practical difficulties in using preference or utility theory in the analysis of decisions involving uncertainty: (1) assessing the preference curve, and (2) doing calculations with the resultant curve, which may not have an analytically-convenient functional form. The paper identifies circumstances under which simplifications can be found which overcome these difficulties, while at the same time properly reflecting attitude towards risk in the analysis. It is assumed that a decision-maker must choose between risks <tex-math>$\tilde{w}_{1}$</tex-math> and <tex-math>$\tilde{w}_{2}$</tex-math>. He wishes to make decisions consistent with a preference curve u (·) which exists, but has not necessarily been assessed, so he can choose i to maximize expected preference, <tex-math>$Eu(\tilde{w}_{i})$</tex-math>. Most results require that the cumulative probability distribution of <tex-math>$\tilde{w}_{1}$</tex-math> and <tex-math>$\tilde{w}_{2}$</tex-math> cross at most once. The results are widely but not universally applicable. Situations are identified where an easy-to-assess, easy-to-analyze preference curve will serve as a proxy for the decision-maker's own preference curve. These situations permit use of any preference curve from a class having a specified relationship with the decision-maker's curve. For example, in some instances a negative exponential (constant risk aversion) preference function can be used in place of the decision-maker's curve, and in others an expected value analysis will suffice.

,,,Creating Transformational Executive Education Programs,"This essay concerns the design of transformational executive programs. A transformational program presupposes a change in behavior of the attending executive so that the latter becomes more effective in personal or organizational change. To understand what influences the transformational process three triangular conceptual frameworks (building on the short-term dynamic psychotherapy tradition) are presented: the mental life triangle, the conflict triangle, and the relationships triangle. The first shows that cognitive and emotional processes need to be taken into consideration to create changes in behavior. The second describes the sources of thoughts and feelings that may prompt anxiety and cause defensive reactions prohibiting change and productive use of talents. The third relationships triangle explains how an individual's previous experiences create patterns of response that are repeated throughout life and can become dysfunctional. Five major challenges in program design are also examined: selecting participants; identifying the focal issue on which participants need to work; the creation of a safe transitional space that enables the change process; using the group dynamic to foster transformation and to arrive at internalization of the change process; and the educational implications for faculty, facilitators, and coaches.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40214463,Academy of Management Learning & Education,10.2307_40214463,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,0,2.8934440706507303e-05,0,0.00040128224645741284,0,0.002328872215002775
,,,Deployment of One- vs. Two-Officer Patrol Units: A Comparison of Travel Times,"In this paper we compare the performance of one-officer and two-officer police patrol units using travel time as the measure of performance. We estimate travel times under two different models of dispatch operations. The first model reflects most existing dispatch systems in which patrol units are assigned to specific beats. Under this beat system, the dispatcher does not know the precise location of each police unit, so he often does not dispatch the closest unit. The second model treats a dispatch operation that is supported by an automatic vehicle monitoring system (AVM). With this system, police units can patrol an overlapping region and the closest available unit to a call can always be dispatched. Probabilistic models are used to derive formulae for estimating travel times to calls requiring only one officer (Type 1) and to calls requiring two officers (Type 2) for each of the two dispatch models. We compared the deployment of the same number of officers in either one- or two-officer units over a wide range of unavailability rates. The general findings are summarized as follows: 1. The average travel time of one-officer units to Type 1 calls is at least 30% less than the average travel time of two-officer units. The difference between the two average travel times increases as the unavailability rate increases. 2. The average travel time of the first-arriving one-officer unit at a Type 2 call is at least 40% less than that of the first-arriving two-officer unit. 3. With non-AVM dispatching and normal patrol beats, the difference between the average travel time of the second-arriving one-officer unit and the first-arriving two-officer unit is sensitive to the unavailability rate. For low unavailability rates the two-officer unit is preferred, and for high unavailability rates two one-officer units are preferred. 4. With AVM dispatching and no beats, the average travel time of the second-arriving one-officer unit to a Type 2 call is almost always less than the average travel time of the first-arriving two-officer unit. Again the difference between the two travel times increases as the unavailability rate increases. We also used our models to explore the impact of manpower reductions that might accompany a switch to one-officer units. Our results suggest that the existence of an AVM system can be a critical factor when considering manpower reductions. Without an AVM system, the changeover is likely to have mixed results; shorter average travel times for the first-arriving officer and longer travel times for the second-arriving officer. With an AVM system, it appears that manpower can be reduced in a changeover while reducing the average travel times for both the first- and second-arriving officers. In addition, the results suggest that the existence of an AVM system can significantly affect the average time between the arrival of the first and second one-officer units. This statistic is a measure of the exposure to danger of the first officer to arrive at the scene. Thus, it may be attractive for a police decision-maker to consider the introduction of an AVM system combined with a changeover from two-officer to one-officer units and a manpower reduction. This is one of the few examples in which new technology can be used to reduce the manpower needs of a police department. At the close of the paper some of the results of our analysis are illustrated with an example. For this specific example we estimate travel time statistics for both dispatch models and discuss manpower reductions and tradeoffs among different travel time measures. We conclude with a discussion of future research directions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631288,Management Science,10.2307_2631288,Management & Organizational Behavior,1981.0,0,2.1193958673393354e-05,0,0.00021641732018906623,0,0.0031604203395545483

,,,The Optimal Acquisition of Automation to Enhance the Productivity of Labor,"Decisions concerning the mix of automation and labor employed by an organization are embedded in the long-term strategic plan since the composition of productive capacity impacts on an organization's ability to survive and compete. In this paper, the optimal mix of automation and labor is identified for automation which acts to enhance the productivity of an organization's workforce. The incentives considered for acquiring automation are increasing the level of output, reducing the high cost of labor, and compensating for a limited supply of labor. Factors explicitly examined by the model include the future long-term goal level of output, costs associated with maintaining the workforce (wages) and automation, and costs associated with changing the levels of workforce and automation. Since the formulation is dynamic so that all exogenous and decision variables may be expressed as functions of time, the effects of technological improvement, increasing wage rates, changing labor supply, and diminishing returns as additional automation is acquired are considered.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631740,Management Science,10.2307_2631740,Management & Organizational Behavior,1985.0,0,8.078043720161077e-06,0,0.00023139279801398516,0,0.0012945806374773383

,,,"Safety Specialists in Industry: Roles, Constraints and Opportunities","This paper comments on the slow and uneven occupational development of safety specialists in British industry. It provides an analysis of possible strategies for safety specialists by identifying three main areas of activity: processing and generating information, giving advice and participating in problem-solving, and taking direct action. These may be practised at each of the following five stages involved in the technical control of hazards: identification of hazards, assessment of risk, development of controls, implementation of controls and longer-term monitoring and adaptation. The position of specialists encountered in eight case studies in the chemical and related industries is then described. The third section advocates the role of the specialist as adviser and discusses the importance of line management assuming direct executive responsibility for the health and safety of those for whom they are directly responsible. The paper acknowledges some of the obstacles facing specialists who wish to develop a strong advisory and problem-solving function. It considers the specialists' access to the following sources of power and influence: managerial dependence on their expertise, patronage within the hierarchy, a direct controlling function, internal coalitions formed with representatives of the workforce, external coalition formed with the factory inspectorate, formal organizational position and their personal qualities of charm and leadership. Comments are made on how aspects of the organizational context and climate of opinion affect the specialists' access to these power sources and the final section of the paper considers the effect of different recruitment and career paths of the specialists themselves.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3000152,Journal of Occupational Behaviour,10.2307_3000152,Management & Organizational Behavior,1984.0,0,0.00029109683237038553,1,0.6742457151412964,0,0.0029267638456076384
,,,A Model of Knowledge Management and the N-Form Corporation,"A model of knowledge management is developed. It builds on the interplay between articulated and tacit knowledge at four different levels: the individual, the small group, the organization, and the interorganizational domain. The model is applied on differences between Western and Japanese patterns of knowledge management. These are related to organizational characteristics, such as employment systems, career patterns, and organization structure. Effective knowledge management is argued to require departures from the logic of hierarchical organization and the M-form structure. The alternative N-form is characterized and suggested as more appropriate. It entails combination of knowledge rather than its division, which is the basic principle in the M-form. Other attributes of the N-form are: temporary constellations of people, the importance of personnel at `lower levels', lateral communication, a catalytic and architectural role for top management, strategies aimed at focusing and economies of depth, and heterarchical structures.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486877,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_2486877,Management & Organizational Behavior,1994.0,0,8.501338743371889e-05,0,0.00029196374816820025,0,0.01178699266165495

,,,Empirical Evidence regarding the Tension between Knowledge Sharing and Knowledge Expropriation in Collaborations,"Interfirm collaborations can raise a fundamental dilemma. To create value, collaborators may have to adopt a variety of practices to facilitate knowledge transfer. Deploying these practices may increase the likelihood that economically valuable knowledge, which is (1) beyond the scope of the collaboration, and (2) difficult to legally protect, is expropriated. How can firms manage this dilemma? The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the veracity of a chain of propositions addressing this dilemma based on a novel joint knowledge-based view/transaction cost economics framework. A plausible chain of relationships is briefly summarized and explored in detail empirically using unrelated datasets. The chain links two knowledge-based attributes of collaboration-knowledge tacitness and problem-solving complexity-to the use of knowledge management practices-high-bandwidth communication channels and co-specialized communication codes. These practices are economic responses to knowledge-sharing difficulties as measured by tacitness and complexity. Increasing knowledge transparency via knowledge management practices, however, gives rise to opportunism hazards, which are safeguarded against via economizing governance choice. Our empirical effort examines the effects that two knowledge attributes of collaborations have on governance choice, first directly and then indirectly through the intervening linkages. Empirical results from both datasets indicate substantial support for the proposed chain of relationships. The results are provocative in that they offer the first preliminary evidence for a plausible reconciliation of two perspectives previously treated exclusively as adversaries.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25151324,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_25151324,Management & Organizational Behavior,2004.0,0,2.653888805070892e-05,0,0.034432101994752884,0,9.923929610522464e-06

If two-part tariffs with non-negative royalties and fixed fees are feasible, the patent holder finds it optimal to license the strong firm exclusively whether or not an exclusive licensing of the weak firm deters the strong firm from entering the market.

,,,Industry Analysis and Investment Decision-Making under Conditions of Uncertainty,"Evaluating risk is a key element in successful investment decision-making. A major risk in forecasting company performance is associated with projecting its cash flow streams by product-line which in turn is strongly related to the expected industry outlook and likely variability about this outlook. This paper sets out a methodology for evaluating this aspect of the investment decision by developing measures of expected real cash flow growth (reward) and expected annual variability of this growth (risk). These measures are constructed for 77 industry classifications at the two and three digit SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) level of detail by solving a dynamic input-output model under various economic scenarios. Aside from producing results which are relevant for producing company valuation bands, the analysis strongly suggests that perceptions of which industries are `winners' and which are `losers' are significantly altered when both `reward' and `risk' are used as criteria as opposed to either one alone. Finally, the methodology also produces results which measure the sources of cash flow growth in terms of relative price performance, productivity, and demand for output. Since there measures can be used as indicators of the quality of industry real cash flow growth, industry performance can be further arrayed within the broad categories of winning and losing industries. Several examples of how this is done are offered.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2487196,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_2487196,Management & Organizational Behavior,1983.0,0,9.956139365385752e-06,0,0.0007087707635946572,0,0.00011334024020470679
,,,Investment in Yugoslavia: Western Opportunities and Difficulties,"Yugoslavia, a semi-developed country with a strong growth potential, has partially opened its doors to foreign investors in order to attain a rate of economic growth consistent with the de-mands of its economic System. Evaluation of business, economic, political, and legal environ-ment as well as basic conditions for joint ventures, rights of partners, duration of joint venture, repatriation of capital of foreign partner, legal rights and guarantees, and investment opportunities in Yugoslavia vs. other countries are discussed in terms of feasibility of investing Western capital into economic activities in Yugoslavia. In addition, economic advantages and investment incentives as well as obstacles to the growth of foreign investments in Yugoslavia are detailed. It may be concluded that the foreign investor who invest for the purpose of acquiring quick and exceptionally high returns on his investment would not choose Yugoslavia. However, for the investor who seeks to expand his own business, use his own patents, technology and marketing know how, Yugoslavia offers cheap labor, abundance of raw material and electrical energy, and excellent geographie position for placement of his products not only in Yugoslavia, but also in other countries of the world and especially in the countries where Yugoslavia has the beneficiai status (East Europe, Asia, and Africa). /// La Yougoslavie, un pays semi-développé avec un potentiel de croissance élevé, a partiellement ouvert ses portes aux investisseurs étrangers afin d'atteindre un taux de croissance économique en rapport avec son système économique.

Ensuite, les avantages économiques et les motifs stimulant l'investissement en Yougoslavie, mais aussi les obstacles qui s'opposent à l'accroissement des investissements étrangers en Yougoslavie sont traités en détail. On arrive à la conclusion que l'investisseur étranger qui cherche à placer des capitaux dans le but d'obtenir un rendement rapide et exceptionnellement élevé, ne choisira pas la Yougoslavie. A l'investisseur qui, en revanche, cherche à étendre sa propre affaire, à employer ses propres brevets, technologies et expériences commerciales, la Yougoslavie offre une main-d'œuvre à bon marché, des matières premières et de l'énergie électrique en abondance et une excellente position géographique pour l'écoulement de ses produits non seulement en Yougoslavie, mais encore dans d'autres pays du monde et surtout dans ceux des pays où la Yougoslavie jouit d'un état bénéficiaire. /// Jugoslawien, zum Teil noch Entwicklungsland, jedoch mit großem Wachstumspotential versehen, hat damit begonnen, seine Tore für ausländische Anleger zu öffnen, um eine Wachstumsrate zu erreichen, die den Anforderungen seines Wirtschaftssystems gerecht wird.

,,,Organizational Information Systems: Determinants of Their Performance and Behavior,"This paper is concerned with organizational information systems. Examples of such systems include intelligence systems, communications systems, management information systems, decision support systems, and administrative control systems. Systems such as these are critical to an organization's functioning; indeed to its survival. The paper is intended to be of use to three types of professionals: those who study organizations; those who design information systems; and those who manage. This fact causes the paper to differ in a number of ways from earlier works dealing with organizational communications and related topics. For example, the paper draws on three different literatures: the psychological literature dealing with perception and cognition, the social-psychological literature dealing with the role of motivation in communications, and the organizational literature dealing with behavior in information systems. Further, the paper gives greater attention than do earlier works to logistical determinants of information system effectiveness, such as the workload of the unit processing the message or the priority assigned to a message, as contrasted with social-psychological determinants. Finally, the explicit introduction of judgement and argument by analogy when direct evidence is unavailable is a third way in which the paper differs from earlier works. The paper focuses in particular on the determinants of the performance and behavior of systems such as those mentioned above. It discusses in some detail the impact of these determinants on four processes that are of key importance in the operation of information systems. Two of these processes are used to increase system efficiency. One, message routing causes any particular message to be distributed to relatively few organizational units, and thus greatly reduces the information processing load of the many units that might otherwise be involved in receiving or relaying the message. The other, message summarizing, plays a similar role. It has as its purpose reducing the size of the message while at the same time faithfully reproducing its meaning. The remaining two processes follow from the fact that organizational units necessarily exercise some discretion in the way that they handle messages. Message delay is a consequence of the priority assignment given a message, and in many cases enhances the effectiveness not only of the operating unit but of the organization as a whole. Message modification refers to the distortion of message meaning. Its source may be either the cognitive limitations or the motivations of the sender or receiver. Modifications may be conscious or unconscious, well-intended or malicious. Each of these four processes is discussed in some depth. More specifically, the several determinants of the probability or extensiveness of each process's occurrence are identified. The literature related to the various process- determinant pairings is then reviewed, and is summarized in the form of propositions. Several areas where additional research is needed are noted and recommendations are made concerning what the nature of such research should be.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631299,Management Science,10.2307_2631299,Management & Organizational Behavior,1982.0,0,3.216520417481661e-05,0,0.0009622877696529031,0,0.00017613745876587927

In this paper, using a case study of the forest industry in Canada, the antecedents of cooperative R&D and the forms it take are investigated. We show how market failures are corrected in the industry largely through industry wide R&D consortia. The share of government funding to maintain the cooperation reflects the degree to which the consortia can appropriate the full value of their knowledge products (i.e. prevent spillover of innovations to non-members in Canada and elsewhere). The case study indicates that the prime role of these nationwide consortia is the provision of potential access to R&D expertise, technological intelligence, and technology transfer services. The success and stability of these consortia depend on the degree to which their governance systems allow for better alignment of the costs and benefits that accrue to members from the consortia.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/30035576,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_30035576,Management & Organizational Behavior,2003.0,0,1.8083195755025372e-05,0,0.006936279591172934,0,2.3706123101874255e-05
