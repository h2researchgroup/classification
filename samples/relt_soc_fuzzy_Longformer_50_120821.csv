0,,,,INDUSTRIALIZATION AND THE FAMILY TYPE: AN INTEGRATED OVERVIEW,"This paper codifies and analyzes the theoretical arguments and the empirical findings concerning the relationships between industrialization and the family type. Both the ""orthodox"" view, which sees industrialization the cause leading to change of the family type, and the challenges against it are presented. The orthodox view is analyzed in terms of the arguments regarding the ""isolated nuclear family"" as an ideal type, the dysfunctional relationships between the extended family and industrialization, and the functional ""fitness"" between the nuclear family and industrialization. The general assumptions of the orthodox view are also discussed. Challenges against the orthodox view are grouped under the following categories: (a) The arguments that the extended family may not be dysfunctional, that the extended family may in fact be functional, and that the nuclear family may be dysfunctional. (b) Findings showing that the asserted prevalence of the extended family in the past and the isolation of the nuclear family in the industrial society today may both be myths. (c) The direction of the causal link, arguments that the two key variables may be reversed and that some other variables should be taken into consideration. The author concludes that the issue is yet unsettled and that a synthesized study is needed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23027127,International Journal of Sociology of the Family,10.2307_23027127,Sociology,1974.0,0,0.005006767809391022,0,0.0008237379952333868,0,0.37053751945495605,0.9648167490959167,1
1,,,,Trends in Residential Segregation: 1960-1970,"The literature on racial residential segregation in American metropolitan areas reports contradictory findings on the decade of the sixties. Some researchers have concluded that average scores declined between 1960 and 1970, while other point to evidence of increases. This paper presents tract-based indexes for all 237 SMSAs (and their central cities) in 1970 and a comparable set of indexes for 1960. These are also cross-tabulated against region, population size, and minority proportion. Several conclusions are drawn: (1) overall, the data indicate a general decline in the average level of segregation between 1960 and 1970; (2) much of that decline is due to the relatively low scores among SMSAs added during the decade; (3) contradictory findings reported in the literature are likely to be due to sampling or other methodological inconsistencies; and (4) clear variations in levels of segregation persist with regard to region, population size, and minority proportion. The importance of these findings for future research is discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2777682,American Journal of Sociology,10.2307_2777682,Sociology,1977.0,0,3.0827821319689974e-05,0,0.18590563535690308,1,0.9986975193023682,0.9999531507492065,1
2,,,,Czechs and Slovaks 1918-1938,"This article analyzes the relations between Czechs and Slovaks as a problem of the position of Slovakia in the Czechoslovak Republic, that is, as a solution to the decentralization of administration and autonomy, which are underscored by the issues of the Pittsburgh Agreement, Prague centralism and ""Czechoslovakism"". A revision of the place of Slovakia in the Czechoslovak Republic was accepted in regard to the requirements of Slovakia (the absence of its own intelligentsia and the presence of the Magyar element in the civil service) and the conditions in the democratic state. When the Slovak intelligentsia finally came of age and wished to participate in public administration, the existential conditions of the Czechoslovak state had changed (Hitler's rise to power, the birth of the Henlein movement in the Czechoslovak Republic). The situation got worse socially as a result of the world-wide depression. Without the Munich Agreement and Germany's share in the birth of the Slovak State, the conditions for the break-up of the Czechoslovak Republic would not have been present. The population formed a consensus in favour of the state, as is clear from the electoral returns, especially the success of Slovenská jednota za Česko-slovenskú republiku a demokraciu [Slovak unity for the Czecho-Slovak Republic and democracy] in the local elections of May 1938.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43945168,Czech Sociological Review,10.2307_43945168,Sociology,1993.0,0,0.003185616573318839,1,0.9999500513076782,0,0.0034053672570735216,0.9999982118606567,1
3,,,,"Outliers, Leverage Observations, and Influential Cases in Factor Analysis: Using Robust Procedures to Minimize Their Effect","Parallel to the development in regression diagnosis, this paper defines good and bad leverage observations in factor analysis. Outliers are observations that deviate from the factor model, not from the center of the data cloud. The effects of each kind of outlying observations on the normal distribution-based maximum likelihood estimator and the associated likelihood ratio statistic are studied through analysis. The distinction between outliers and leverage observations also clarifies the roles of three robust procedures based on different Mahalanobis distances. All the robust procedures are designed to minimize the effect of certain outlying observations. Only the robust procedure with a residual-based distance properly controls the effect of outliers. Empirical results illustrate the strength or weakness of each procedure and support those obtained in analysis. The relevance of the results to general structural equation models is discussed and formulas are provided.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20451157,Sociological Methodology,10.2307_20451157,Sociology,2008.0,0,2.7226842576055788e-05,0,0.0012117911828681827,0,0.055198825895786285,0.9887053370475769,1
4,,,,Negotiating Strangerhood: Interviews with Homeless Immigrants in Copenhagen,"The results from a study on homeless immigrants in Copenhagen are analysed in this article. Based on 25 life-history interviews with male immigrants living in institutions for the homeless, my focus of concern is the interviewees' self-presentations and their attempts to handle their stigmatized position. Two theoretical approaches are combined. First, the narratives are analysed as representations of the immigrants' marginalized status in their new society. Many narratives echo Bauman's (1991) descriptions of the stranger as someone constructed as a 'permanent other'; someone discredited, blamed and discriminated against because he/she 'threatens the natural order of things'. Second, the narratives are analysed as presentations, i.e. as the narrators' preferred interpretations of their present and past situations (Scott and Lyman, 1968). The narratives are therefore read not just as reflections of 'things that actually happened' to the interviewees, but also as reflections of their strategies in handling these incidents and of their attempts to present themselves in the interviews as persons 'permanently on trial', persons who are 'respectable after all'.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4194984,Acta Sociologica,10.2307_4194984,Sociology,2003.0,0,0.00020152614160906523,0,0.15324485301971436,1,0.952981173992157,0.9922515749931335,1
5,,,,'Losing My Religion': A Dynamic Analysis of Leaving the Church in the Netherlands,"In this article, we examine the influence of individual attributes (education, parental education, religious homogamy of parents, religious homogamy of respondent and spouse, frequency of attending religious services, and denomination) and contextual characteristics (cohort and period effects of secularization) on the risk of leaving a faith, using life-event data from the Dutch Family Survey 1992-1993. This approach allows a stronger test of the direction of causality, and enables us to disentangle life-cycle, period, and cohort effects. The results show that education, parental education, and marrying a non-religious spouse significantly increase the risk of becoming unchurched. With regard to the influence of both one's own and one's parents' education, it appears that up to the level of higher secondary education (HAVO) each higher level of education linearly increases the risk of becoming unchurched. Also, the results show a non-linear life-cycle effect: people are more likely to leave their faith when they are in their late teens. Furthermore, our results suggest a period effect: the current level of secularization increases the risk of becoming unchurched.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/522776,European Sociological Review,10.2307_522776,Sociology,1996.0,0,0.0004219808033667505,0,0.00034312496427446604,0,0.2542465031147003,0.9999988079071045,1

8,,,,The Developing Trend of the People's Mediation in China,"Mediation has long been the preferred method for dispute resolution in China because it serves multiple functions, such as maintaining harmonious social relationships, smoothing away discord, and repressing social conflict. The sustaining forces that support mediation, however, have been weakened since the late 1970s with the profound economic and social transformation, cultural changes, and legal reforms that have taken place in China. As a result, mediation faced unprecedented challenges and was on the wane in the 1990s in urban China and some rural areas. To address this problem, the Chinese government has been making efforts to revitalize mediation since the late 1990s. This study discusses the social and cultural background under which mediation declined during the 1990s; examines the differently evolving patterns of mediation in urban and rural China; discusses the recent reform policies and practices aimed at reviving mediation; and, finally, explains implications for future development of mediation and research.",external-fulltext-any,Sociological Focus,10.2307_41633831,Sociology,,0,0.0012318510562181473,0,0.00022644063574261963,0,0.00013547763228416443,0.999996542930603,1

14,,,,Sex Differences in Reporting Osteoarthritic Symptons: A Sociomedical Approach,"Sex differences in reports of chronic joint symptoms are examined for 6,913 persons aged 25-74 in the detailed component of the U.S. Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1971-75). Support is not found for the hypotheses that women are more willing to report chronic joint symptoms or that men are more likely to underreport symptoms. Symptom reporting for both men and women is significantly related to radiographic evidence of osteoarthrosis and two measures of treatment behavior. Men with osteoarthrosis, however, are more likely to report pain than osteoarthritic women, independent of severity of disease and treatment behavior. The sex differentials in symptom reporting for persons with normal x-rays (96% of the sample) are not significant. In general, men and women are found to be more alike than different in reporting chronic joint symptoms. The data indicate that treatment behavior and disease are important intervening factors to consider in a model examining sex differentials in symptom reporting.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2136523,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_2136523,Sociology,1981.0,0,1.0576602107903454e-05,0,0.0002459562092553824,1,0.9708129167556763,0.9999982118606567,1
15,,,,Age Identity in Context: Stress and the Subjective Side of Aging,"The passage of time is fundamentally experienced through people's interaction with their social worlds. Life-course scholars acknowledge the multiple aspects of time-based experience but have given little attention to age identity in a dynamic context. Drawing from a stress-process model, we expected that turbulence within people's family relations and health declines would produce increases in subjective age. Family role transitions were also examined as potential factors that would hasten subjective aging, but only to the extent that they produced stress. We used the Midlife Development in the United States study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey. Regression results show that turbulence within one's family accelerated age identity and that the effect of diminishing psychosocial resources explained this relationship. For the most part, however, changes within family roles did not affect age identity. On the other hand, the incidence of chronic health problems increased subjective ages, and this relationship too was mediated by the depletion of psychosocial resources. The findings demonstrate an interconnection between the stress process and age identity. Broadening our conception of time-based experience with attention to the stress process offers exciting directions for future theory and research in life course sociology.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27896235,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_27896235,Sociology,2010.0,0,0.00016868139209691435,0,0.0002945630985777825,1,0.8633198738098145,0.9997599720954895,1
16,,,,BIOLOGY AND SOCIAL THEORY: PARSONS'S EVOLUTIONARY THEME,"The evolutionary theme of Parsons's sociology relates his theory of sociocultural evolution to the theory of organic evolution and to the general theory of action systems. To grasp both relationships, the immanence and Darwinian interpretations of Parsonsian evolutionism must be rejected. Parsons's assumptions about the nature of change and the nature of what is changing follow from the use of Emerson's model of group selection as his source analogy. Its holistic conception of the part-whole relationship explains the theoretical fit between Parsonsian evolutionism and the general theory of action systems, and Parsons's exclusion of action from his evolutionary theory. This limitation and Parsons's restricted focus on the course of evolution can both be corrected by introducing individual selection as a source analogy for sociological evolutionism.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42854382,Sociology,10.2307_42854382,Sociology,1987.0,0,3.837258191197179e-05,0,0.0012424321612343192,1,0.7601736783981323,0.7556231617927551,1
17,,,,GIVING VOICE: THE CHALLENGE FOR A WHITE INSTRUCTOR IN A MULTICULTURAL COURSE,"A call has been issued in American colleges and universities for diversity courses taught by those who live the experience. This presents a challenge of credibility particularly salient to white educators teaching multicultural courses. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that this challenge may be met by integrating feminist standpoint epistemology with multicultural pedagogy. I contend that meaningful steps must be taken to incorporate underrepresented voices into multicultural courses. Activities such as discussions, readings, debates, audio-video media, and guest speakers help to amplify minority voices. In addition, reflection papers and team projects provide means to evaluate how clearly students hear the disparate voices presented.

All forms of lifetime exposure were significantly correlated with depression and PTSD, but when they were assessed simultaneously, victimization had the strongest effect. Witnessing violence over the lifetime also had a significant effect on PTSD. High social support was related to fewer symptoms of depression and PTSD. Social support and gender were investigated as moderators. High social support moderated the effects of recent victimization on depression and PTSD. Gender did not moderate the effects of exposure to violence on depression, but it did moderate the effects of recent witnessed violence and violent behavior (both recent and lifetime) on PTSD.

22,,,,The Impact of Foreclosures on Neighborhood Disorder Before and During the Housing Crisis: Testing the Spiral of Decay,"Objectives. The objectives of this study were to examine whether an increasing number of foreclosures in a neighborhood subsequently increase disorder and whether the temporal relationship between foreclosures and disorder is different before and during the housing crisis. Methods. We employ longitudinal data to examine the impact of foreclosure on crime in Glendale, Arizona, a city at the epicenter of the nations foreclosure problem. We rely on three data sources: (1) foreclosure data, (2) Computer-Aided Dispatch/Police Records Management System data, and (3) U. S. Census and census estimate data. Results. Our findings suggest that foreclosures do have a short-term, four-month effect on overall disorder and social disorder; however, that relationship only holds during the months preceding the housing crisis. During the housing crisis, there is no effect of foreclosures on disorder. Conclusions. Our results suggest that instead of the long-standing negative impact that foreclosures have on disorder in communities, their negative effect is short lived and limited. Thus, foreclosures during the housing crisis do not signal disorder and decay as expected. A number of communities across the country have enacted prevention, enforcement, and reuse policies and programs aimed at foreclosure for the purpose of reducing disorder and subsequent crime; our results suggest that some of these policies and programs require substantial resources and might not have their desired impact.",external-fulltext-any,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42864090,Sociology,,0,3.522187762428075e-05,0,0.0007962404051795602,1,0.9007628560066223,0.9999440908432007,1

This analysis is based on data collected from a random sample of eighty-nine couples drawn from two Greek-American parishes and from the directory of the Hellenic Professional Society of Illinois. Findings indicated that the function of ethnic stratification and mobility within the Chicago Greek-American ethnic community becomes attenuated with the oncoming of the second generation Greek-Americans. Social status was transformed from an ethnocenttic focus and orientation in the first generation to one which transcends ethnic boundaries in the second generation. Likewise, indices of social mobility were found to be more meaningful when one views them as aspects of the larger American occupational and class structure rather than as aspects of ethnic stratification .",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41495912,International Review of Sociology,10.2307_41495912,Sociology,1971.0,0,1.1950693988183048e-05,0,0.00022220969549380243,1,0.9996500015258789,0.9934982061386108,1

The National Center for Health Statistics publications on the Volume of Physician Visits show a changing pattern in the use of physician services among income groups during the interval between 1960 and 1968. These data are complemented by findings from a 1971 survey of Rhode Island adults that show an inverse relationship between income and physician visits. The inverse trend in the Rhode Island data goes beyond the national pattern of a flattening of income differentials. The tendency for lower income respondents to be more likely to report physician visits during the previous sixty days as compared to visits reported by persons with larger incomes persisted even when controls were introduced for a number of related factors such as age, the mode of health care delivery used, and the presence of restricted activity days during the time period being studied.

26,,,,Negotiating Neoliberal Multiculturalism: Mapuche Workers in the Chilean State,"A central component of neoliberal multiculturalism in contemporary Latin America is an increase in indigenous individuals who work for the state, implementing indigenous policy at the municipal, regional and national levels. We explore the consequences of the inclusion of these individuals by analyzing the experiences of Mapuche state workers in Chile. We find that Mapuche workers possess a hybrid subjectivity that leads them to engage in both resistance and consent in their daily work lives. They use state resources strategically for what they feel is movement gain, and are often reflexive about the possibilities of cooptation. Nevertheless, they are often party to actions that are detrimental to the movement. The contradictions in Mapuche workers' actions indicate that the results of neoliberal multiculturalism may be more mixed than many scholars acknowledge.

Using survey data containing responses to hypothetical vignettes, we examine these relationships in a sample of 518 community college students. Consistent with attribution theory, causal attributions affect beliefs about persons' responsibility for causing their condition, beliefs which in turn lead to affective reactions, resulting in rejecting responses such as avoidance, coercion, segregation, and withholding help. However, consistent with a danger appraisal hypothesis, the effects of perceptions of dangerousness on helping and rejecting responses are unmediated by responsibility beliefs. Much of the dangerousness effects operate by increasing fear, a particularly strong predictor of support for coercive treatment. The results from this study also suggest that familiarity with mental illness reduces discriminatory responses.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1519806,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_1519806,Sociology,2003.0,0,0.00011603612801991403,0,0.0002077675744658336,0,0.1348503977060318,0.9998812675476074,1

30,,,,Cost-Effective Methods for Accurate Determination of Sea Level Rise Vulnerability:,"For millions of people living along the coastal fringe, sea level rise is perhaps the greatest threat to livelihoods over the coming century. With the refinement and downscaling of global climate models and increasing availability of airborne-lidar-based inundation models, it is possible to predict and quantify these threats with reasonable accuracy where such information is available. For less developed countries, especially small island states, access to high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from lidar is limited. The only freely available DEMs that could be used for inundation modeling by these nations are those based on data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). These data, with a horizontal resolution of ≈90 m and a vertical accuracy of ±5–10 m, are generally unsuitable for local-scale planning and adaption projects. To address this disparity, low-cost ground-based techniques were tested and applied to accurately determine coastal topography in the Solomon Islands. This method had a significantly improved vertical accuracy (±2 cm) and was readily learned by local community members, who were able to independently map and determine the vulnerability of their costal community to inundation from sea level rise. For areas where lidar is not economically viable, this method is intended to provide an important balance of cost, simplicity, accuracy, and local participation that can assist remote coastal communities with coastal planning decisions. The method can enhance local capacity and arguably promotes more meaningful local engagement in sea level rise planning and adaptation activities.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24907527,"Weather, Climate, and Society",10.2307_24907527,Sociology,2013.0,0,1.6014349967008457e-05,0,0.00035556143848225474,0,0.027131522074341774,0.9954332113265991,1

These ethical practices are based in large part on epistemological investigations which are aimed at disclosing the nature of understanding and the structure of perception, philosophical investigations which have much in common with Western philosophical traditions, including Phenomenology. Where the Phenomenologists pursue such inquiries without extensive consideration of the ethical consequences they might have, the Tibetan philosophers are concerned with applying these philosophical insights to ethical domains, providing for their ethical practices a sound philosophical basis, in addition to the religious basis they also have. This cultural praxis of the Tibetans is not merely a relic of South Asian civilization recorded in written texts, but constitutes a body of ordinary practices for the Tibetan people.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23262661,Humboldt Journal of Social Relations,10.2307_23262661,Sociology,1986.0,0,0.00016018432506825775,0,0.00020082620903849602,0,0.0019346715416759253,0.7491468787193298,1

36,,,,The Philippine Social Indicators Project,"The Social Indicators Project of the Development Academy of the Philippines (1974) aimed to formulate a measurement system capable of objectively depicting periodic changes in national development. It identified the following as basic Philippine social concerns: (1) Health and Nutrition, (2) Learning, (3) Income and Consumption, (4) Employment, (5) Non-human Productive Resources, (6) Housing, Utilities, and the Environment, (7) Public Safety and Justice, (8) Political Values, and (9) Social Mobility. This list is unique in considering political welfare. A multi-disciplinary research team selected 30 major indicators pertinent to these concerns. Although the majority are already encompassed by the Philippine statistical system, certain new indicators were proposed, including disability due to illness, human capital created by schooling, net beneficial product, families below a food threshold, an index of housing adequacy, an air pollution index for Greater Manila, an index of perceived public safety, indices of political mobility and efficacy, and indices of occupational mobility and perceived social mobility. A survey of 1000 households was used to demonstrate the feasibility of gathering needed new primary data, particularly those attitudinal in nature. An analysis of time series showed that certain aspects of Philippine welfare have been notably improving, but that others have been worsening; the direction of national progress can only be ascertained by admitting value-judgments on the relative importance of the several components of welfare.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27521814,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_27521814,Sociology,1977.0,0,2.660086829564534e-05,0,0.00023038631479721516,0,0.007636378053575754,0.9999397993087769,1
37,,,,A Typology of Progressive Catholics: A Study of the Delegates to the National Pastoral Congress,"This paper describes an attempt to construct a typology of progressive Catholics using data obtained from a survey of the delegates to the 1980 National Pastoral Congress of English Catholics eighteen months after the Congress. Progressivism is regarded as the espousal of the new elements of religious ideology and pastoral emphases which have emerged since the Second Vatican Council. Following earlier attempts using smallest space analysis and factor analysis, this paper describes the use of cluster analysis to identify distinct groups of individuals and discriminant analysis to identify the separate dimensions which distinguish between the clusters. Seven clusters were identified in terms of six discriminant functions. An analysis of the social and religious characteristics of the seven types indicated that there was no simple unidimensional scale of progressivism. The paper concludes with some suggestions for a more comprehensive classification of progressive Catholics which might be explored in the case of other or more representative samples.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1385796,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1385796,Sociology,1987.0,1,0.9989457726478577,0,0.0005578255513682961,0,0.13467180728912354,0.9999932050704956,1

Our results reveal that spousal separation due to temporary migration reduces birth probabilities in the short term but does not reduce marital fertility in the long term. However, when women migrate to the U.S. either as temporary migrants or as long-term settled migrants, their experiences lead to lower birth probabilities while in the U.S. as well as to fewer total births. By contrast, U.S. migration experience among men who return to Mexico is associated with higher marital fertility in Mexico, suggesting that temporary migrants are selected for higher fertility.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3086510,Social Forces,10.2307_3086510,Sociology,2002.0,0,1.739678918966092e-05,0,0.0003180034982506186,0,0.33596423268318176,0.9915122389793396,1

A taxonomy divides the corpus into jokes lampooning rigidity, exaggerated deference to authority, difficulty in language acquisition, and alienation from the new society. The jokes carry a dual message of welcome to our egalitarian nation, but please note that we, and our norms, were here first. The ethnic superiority implicit in the latter part of the message turns the tables on two earlier encounters-in Germany and the United States-in which Jewish immigrants from Russia and Poland were denigrated for ""embarrassing"" their relatively well-established German brethren. The Yekke jokes analyzed in this article arose from a third encounter in Palestine/Israel, where, this time, the Eastern Europeans arrived earlier, as Zionist pioneers.

48,,,,The Impact of Domestic Work on Men's and Women's Wages,"Past research has consistently found that the negative relationship between housework and wages is stronger for women than for men. This article tests a potential explanation for this difference by focusing on the fact that men and women typically perform different types of household chores. Traditionally ""feminine"" and ""masculine"" task types are likely to interfere with work differently, because they vary as to when and how often they must be performed. Based on longitudinal data from the National Survey of Families and Households, fixed-effects regression results show that only time spent in female housework chores has a negative effect on wages. Furthermore, gender differences in the effect of housework disappear upon disaggregating housework into task types. This research suggests that a more equitable distribution of not only the amount, but also the type, of housework performed by men and women in the home may lead to a narrowing of the gender gap in wages.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3599819,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_3599819,Sociology,2001.0,0,1.481183062423952e-05,0,0.00044570252066478133,1,0.9869816899299622,0.9966623783111572,1
