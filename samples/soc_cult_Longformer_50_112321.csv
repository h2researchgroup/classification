,,,"Advertising Motherhood: Image, Ideology, and Consumption","Using five decades of magazine advertisements, I document changes in advertising images of mothers and examine the relationship between the ideology of motherhood presented in the ads and patterns of consumption. In terms of the representation of mothers, three findings stand out. First, the images presented are consistent between magazines in terms of the layout of the ads, the figures presented, the physical attributes of mothers, and suggested maternal roles. Second, the portrayal of motherhood over time is nonlinear and can be divided into distinct phases by decade. These phases highlight an ideological shift in the presentation of motherhood from domestically centered to childcentered expertise. Third, the advertised products presented in each phase vary significantly. I link these shifts to shifts in consumption patterns and examine the processes by which ""intensive mothering"" emerged as a central focus and force in modern consumer culture.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41035601,Berkeley Journal of Sociology,10.2307_41035601,Sociology,2005.0,1,0.9953267574310303,0,0.00017814045713748783,0,0.0005238408339209855

Simultaneously, they argued for the existence of specific isomorphic processes as structuring devices leading to organizational similarity based on sensitizing concepts other than efficiency.

In the state and local education policy arena, we argue, that while some of the prerequisites of DiMaggio and Powell's model appeared to be structurally present in the form of resource dependency relationships and varying degrees of shared normative values, these did not lead to institutional isomorphism as they envision.

The article charts a series of episodes of moral panic in this period, in which media concern over black 'youth' rose and fell in line with the meandering path of inter-party negotiations over constitutional change. The category of 'youth' provided a concrete form and supposed justification for white South Africans fears of social transformation: amoral 'youth' somehow both symbolised and constituted the dreaded scenario of anarchy which negotiations were supposed to avert. The 'youth' were initially deemed the product of the strategies and practices of the African National Congress (ANC). Ultimately, however, it was the ANC leadership which defused the moral panic over the 'youth' through maintaining order during the crisis following the assassination of Chris Hani in 1993. South Africa's political transition was paralleled by a shift in discourse, as fears of a ANC-linked anarchy gave way to an acceptance of the ANC as a guarantor of order.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/44461287,South African Sociological Review,10.2307_44461287,Sociology,1995.0,1,0.8929129242897034,0,0.08207028359174728,0,0.12576398253440857

,,,The Emergence of Penal Extremism in California: A Dynamic View of Institutional Structures and Political Processes,"This article examines legal and political developments in California in the 1970s and early 1980s that led to extreme changes in the state's use of imprisonment. It uses historical research methods to illustrate how institutional and political processes interacted in dynamic ways that continuously unsettled and reshaped the crime policy field. It examines crime policy developments before and after the passage of the state's determinate sentencing law to highlight the law's long-term political implications and to illustrate how it benefited interest groups pushing for harsher punishment. It emphasizes the role executives played in shaping these changes, and how the law's significance was as much political as legal because it transformed the institutional logics that structured criminal lawmaking. These changes, long sought by the law enforcement lobby, facilitated crime's politicization and ushered in a new era of frenetic and punitive changes in criminal law and punishment. This new context benefited politicians who supported extreme responses to crime and exposed the crime policy process to heightened degrees of popular scrutiny.

The challenge faced by movement organisers in seeking to bring about change – a challenge that forces a social movement to engage strategically as a social actor, with its political-institutional environment — has received, however, relatively little attention. Seeking to fill this gap in the literature I argue that the distinct analytical issues raised by the problem of political strategy which social movements face can only be addressed through a synthesis that builds upon, but goes beyond, the contributions made by American and European scholars. The challenge is to conceive of social movements as strategic actors, while acknowledging the implications that a movement's collective identity and social nature has for an analysis of strategic action.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42855611,Sociology,10.2307_42855611,Sociology,1995.0,1,0.9518908858299255,0,0.0002107501932187006,0,8.582558075431734e-05

The actual substance of such labels is unclear, but with the increasing diffusion of City Challenge and similar initiatives it is likely that 'people-related' themes will be a particular concern for policy-makers in these contexts. Drawing on my experience as a consultant on a project that aimed to operationalise such notions through an exercise designed to elicit the needs of young people in a City Challenge area, this paper examines the ways in which political issues suffuse the research process in contexts like this. Three key issues are examined: how the political priorities of policy-makers impinge upon the conduct of research from the pre-fieldwork stage to well beyond the conclusion of the project; the difficulties experienced in convincing gatekeepers of the efficacy of novel research methods (drama was used in the project); and the importance of the micro-political aspects of research.

Analysis focuses on the setting, appearance and manner of the ""cynical performance"" (Goffman, 1959), orchestrated by the waitress through which she uses some-nudity, nudity and nude dancing to stimulate the fantasies of her patrons and thereby creates ""counterfeit intimacy"" (Boles and Garbin, 1987).

,,,The Normative Foundations of Social Theory: An Essay on the Criteria Defining Social Economics,"Two views of human nature underlie economic theory and any theory incorporating either view is not social economics. The first view sees human nature as metaphysically or genetically given. This view has difficulty giving differences in the structure and functioning of different societies any importance. The other view asserts that humans are entirely ""created"" by society. In this view, humans are merely malleable ""stuff"" which a society molds into ""building blocs"" appropriate to that society. Hunt argues that social economics lies mid-way between these extremes. Humans are ""molded"" by the social system of which they are a part, but that socialization is never total because humans are not ""malleable stuff."" There is a human nature that sometimes resists and occasionally negates socialization. Human nature is a complex set of innate needs and potentialities. Socialization creates ""wants"" the satisfaction of which may contribute to the satisfaction of the underlying needs, and leads to activities that develop to a certain degree the underlying potentialities. It is the task of social economics to identify those needs and potentialities and to formulate a ""vision"" of the fully developed human being.

Previous studies have shown that the application of forecasts into water management is not pervasive. This study uses a scenario-based approach to explore whether and how people implement forecast information into reservoir operations decisions in a workshop setting. Although it was found that participants do utilize both forecast and observed information, they generally do not utilize probabilistic forecast information in a manner to appropriately minimize risks associated with the tail end of the forecast distribution. This study found strong tendencies for participants to wait for observed information, as opposed to forecast information, before making decisions. In addition, study participants tended to make decisions based on median forecast values instead of considering forecast probability.

         explored in the social context of a correctional institution for women. The purpose of this study is to investigate emotional experiences from the unique perspective of incarcerated women. This research
         examines how women in prison perceive and manage their emotional lives while confined and asks whether their chosen strategies have an impact on their interactions and thus affect the institutional environment.
         Data were collected through in-depth interviews with thirty-five women incarcerated in a correctional institution located in the midwestern United States. Using a semistructured interview schedule, respondents
         were asked about a range of topics, one of which involved their emotional lives while incarcerated. Findings indicate these women define their emotional experiences as being simultaneously provocative and
         constrained. Respondents suggest that their emotional resources are individually, contextually, and culturally grounded. They discuss employing various strategies to manage their emotional lives while incarcerated,

,,,MOTHERING IN THE BORDERLANDS: Policing Native American Women's Reproductive Healthcare,"Native American women's motherhood has historically been targeted for surveillance, control, and outright removal by the State in its efforts to ensure cultural homogeneity within its borders (Smith 1996 and 2002; White and Martin 2008; Volscho 2010); state-sponsored reproductive healthcare provides one means of producing and protecting these borders. At the same time, contemporary discussions of ""traditional family values"" as they derive from politicized constructions of the Standard North American Family (Smith 1999) marginalize all other family forms, re-locating these families outside of the ideological borders of social and political acceptability. In this article, I argue that motherhood is central to both the nationalized family ideal and the construction of deviant families and therefore women's reproductive bodies become a specific target of regulation. Native women as potential and actual mothers challenge the ideal Standard North American Family by inserting racial/ethnic and cultural diversity into the national narrative of Traditional Family Values. It is my contention that the Indian Health Service (IHS), a federal agency located in the Department of Health and Human Services, provides an avenue for the State's control of these divergent identities through the policing of Native women's motherhood, and that this is accomplished through complex interactions of control and neglect practiced on Native women's reproductive bodies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23029787,International Journal of Sociology of the Family,10.2307_23029787,Sociology,2011.0,1,0.9902183413505554,0,0.0002019731909967959,0,0.38950684666633606

,,,"""Taking the Gravel Road"": Educational Aspirations of Working Class Malay Youths","Applying Bourdieu's theoretical framework on the correspondence between mental structures and social structures, this paper examines the persistence of educational underachievement among working class Malay youths in Singapore. Accordingly, my first objective is to document the social structure, namely a largely working class neighbourhood where these Malay youths have grown up. My second aim is to analyse how everyday cultural practices and interactions among peers in the neighbourhood significantly reinforced these youths' levelled aspirations. I maintain that by believing in 'taking the gravel road', which is symbolically rough, uneven and uncertain, these youths justified the irrelevance of doing well in school. Succinctly, this essay demonstrates the close correspondence between the perceptions of the odds of success and the educational underperformance of the Malay youths.

,,,Individual and Institutional Determinants of Multidimensional Poverty: A European Comparison,"In this article we evaluate to what extent between-country differences in the probability of being 'multidimensional' poor can be explained by a range of 'domain-specific' indicators of welfare regime arrangements. To this end, a so-called micro-macro model is estimated, testing the 'independent' effect of institutions, as opposed to alternative explanations such as between-country differences in population composition and economic affluence. Although we conclude that institutional arrangements do influence the risk of multidimensional poverty in the expected direction, we also find that bringing the 'economy' back into the analyses has a non-trivial impact. Our results point at several avenues for further discussion and research. First, although the more elaborate welfare regimes generally do a better job in preventing poverty, the level of transfers is not always 'proportional' to the general standard of living in these countries. Second, we only find partial confirmation for the often cited 'negative' impact of labour market flexibility and the related equality-jobs trade-off. While stricter employment regulations do reduce the poverty risk (be it only after controlling for economic affluence), flexibility in terms of the availability of fixed-term labour seems to be preferable to unemployment, even if at the individual level, labour market flexibility increase the likelihood of being poor quite severely.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27734618,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_27734618,Sociology,2008.0,1,0.7633097171783447,1,0.7138398885726929,0,0.16524523496627808

Debates about social justice are deeply complicated, however, as evident in the range of responses to the events of September
         11, 2001. In this essay I trace micro-level phenomena and processes that contribute to understanding social justice and the tensions that surround it. I argue that the Western social contractarian conception
         of justice does not incorporate the legacies of historical inequities and therefore is less useful than conceptions of justice that emphasize compassion, need, and forgiveness. I review a wide-ranging social
         psychological literature on social cognitive and social interactive dynamics that both contribute to and could be used to minimize social inequities, emphasizing dynamics of social categorization and ways
         in which social power shapes the construction and use of social categorization. I argue that the achievement of social justice will require not only institutional interventions but, in the end, that individuals
         act for justice.

For Foucault, method can best be understood as a ruse rather than as a method which promises truth. Methods regulate what can be discovered and the discourse about what can be discovered. In this essay, the realist and idealist models of method are criticized from Foucault's perspective. Both models rely on some transcendental reality which -- from Foucault's perspective are constructed by the practices of research itself. Even though Foucault rejects foundational assumptions, he does have a method which has its homogeneity, its systematicity, and its generality.

,,,The Welfare State and Equality? Stratification Realities and Aspirations in Three Welfare Regimes,"Welfare regimes differ in their impact on social inequality in important ways. While previous research has explored the shape of stratification across nations and citizens' normative attitudes towards inequality, scant attention has been given to citizens' perceptions of actual stratification across welfare regimes. Using the 1999 International Social Survey Programme, we compare perceptions of inequality in Germany, Sweden, and the United States. More specifically, we ask how the stratification reality in each country is assessed by its citizens, whether it meets their stratification aspirations, and whether these perceptions differ systematically both across and within welfare regimes. Our results show that perceptions vary in a clear and meaningful way across countries as well as between different social groups within a given welfare regime. For instance, Americans are more likely to view society as unequal, but only slightly more likely to prefer that extent of inequality. Conversely, the Swedish clearly view their society as more equal than citizens in the United States and Germany, yet not nearly as equal as they would like it to be. Our multivariate results reveal important similarities and differences as well, such as socio-economic cleavages in the United States, and cleavages between labour market insiders and outsiders in Germany.",external-fulltext-any,European Sociological Review,10.2307_41495486,Sociology,,0,1.8333064872422256e-05,0,0.00028937956085428596,1,0.9768499135971069

,,,Beyond Educational Inequality in Czechoslovakia,"This paper addresses questions of the applicability of the meritocratic thesis to the explanation of educational inequality in Czechoslovakia. I defend the hypothesis that ""non-meritocratic"" or even ""anti-meritocratic"" processes might have generated patterns of social fluidity almost identical to those based on meritocratic selection. The arguments backing this thesis come from comparative research in educational mobility and inequality, and from the first wave of the longitudinal survey ""Family 1989"" started in Czechoslovakia in January 1989, almost a year before the November revolution. This survey, among other things, dealt with strategies for life success among teenagers and their parents. A ""non-meritocratic"" hypothesis is discussed, which might explain the relatively strong direct effect of social background on educational attainment in Czechoslovakia and other socialist countries. The hypothesis is based on Bourdieu's concept of ""social capital"". It argues that, because of bureaucratic rules applied in admission policy, the spontaneous tendency of higher social strata to use their ""social capital"" and to pass on social advantages to their offspring in socialist countries seems to be less restricted by meritocratic competition than in advanced capitalist countries. Some preliminary results from the survey ""Family 1989"" show that this hypothesis might be plausible.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41133194,Czechoslovak Sociological Review,10.2307_41133194,Sociology,1992.0,0,1.0586924872768577e-05,0,0.0028606008272618055,1,0.9991191029548645

In this paper arguments are presented for using contextual analysis to study individual labor earnings as a function of both background/investment variables and specific dimensions of areal labor market social and economic organization. Analysis from samples of workers (821 whites, 375 blacks) suggests that, in the presence of numerous controls (1) black earnings levels are hindered by racial competition and residential segregation, and facilitated by export sector productivity; and (2) white earnings levels also are hindered by residential segregation, but facilitated by racial competition and export sector productivity.

Our survey data shows little difference between the career orientations and experiences of men and women. We then test this against the career narratives of 136 managers. Again, we find that men and women use the same 'new capitalism' narratives to describe their careers and work lives. However, whereas for men these narratives fit with their stories of domestic life, this is not the case for the women. Faced with a substantial disjunction between them, women generally reject one or other narrative identity.

,,,"Race, Identity, and Belonging: “Blackness” and the Struggle for Solidarity in a Multiethnic Labor Union","This article presents an ethnographic examination of the ways in which a “black” organization—a 15,000 member labor union in New York City—has been altered and transformed by an influx of immigrant members. By appealing to shared racial experiences and promoting an American “minority” identity, the union's leaders and African American members have successfully incorporated immigrant members and, in the process, have altered the cultural practices and structural forms of the organization. The study argues that this occurred, in part, due to the particular organizational history of the union, and the sense of organizational identity built by union leaders and members. By drawing from the cultural legacy forged by the organization's founders, the union's leaders have developed a new identity for the organization that appears to be a continuation of—and improvement upon—the old. This case thus illustrates the importance of culture in organizational transformation, and also illuminates the ways in which native-born minorities expand their definition of what it means to be “black” in order to successfully incorporate newcomers.

,,,"Realism, Theory, and Individualism in the Work of Carl Menger","Theorizing in economics is often associated with some form of individualism. This paper considers the nature of this association in the work of Carl Menger. I adopt this focus not only because of continuing interest in Menger's work, but because recent developments in social theory facilitate a fruitful reevaluation of his general position. I argue that a convincing link between theory and individualism is absent in Menger's work. Moreover, I argue that the various criticisms often made of his work actually relate to the ideas which underlie his individualism rather than, as is usually supposed, those arising from an adherence to a form of Aristotelianism.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/29769869,Review of Social Economy,10.2307_29769869,Sociology,1996.0,1,0.9988163709640503,1,0.9956145286560059,0,7.22025433788076e-05

,,,The White Savior Film and Reviewers' Reception,"This article documents the collective interpretations of film reviewers, a position typically associated with individual aesthetic judgment rather than socially shared scripts of explanation. Drawing on the reviews of a feature film with implicit racial content, produced in the context of a supposedly ""color-blind"" era, this article documents how reviewers constitute a racialized interpretive community. Reviewers rely on specific cultural frameworks to both contest and reproduce the notion of a ""post-racial"" society. These interpretations equate nonwhites with pathological and dysfunctional traits, frame hard work as a white normative characteristic, and construct deterministic views of both Hollywood's ability to represent progressive racial representations and the educational system's potential. This analysis illustrates how film reviews operate as mediating voices between producer and consumer, and in so doing, the interpretations of the film serve as ""common-sensed"" mappings of the contested terrain of contemporary race relations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/si.2010.33.3.475,Symbolic Interaction,10.1525_si.2010.33.3.475,Sociology,2010.0,1,0.9663432240486145,0,0.0002078652469208464,1,0.9655521512031555
,,,Authoritarianism as World View,"A promising alternative to the psychoanalytic conception of authoritarianism is the ""breadth of perspective"" approach. Several writers have argued that authoritarianism results, at least in part, from the lack of broad social perspectives. However, they have not made it sufficiently clear how breadth of perspective operates to discourage authoritarianism and how it relates to more than one or two of the several components of the authoritarianism complex. By specifically taking account of the particular world view which underlies the interdependent characteristics of authoritarianism, it is possible to explicate the relationship between breadth of perspective and authoritarianism. This world view seems impressively similar to the concept of ""reification,"" as described explicitly or implicitly by a number of social theorists. It is maintained here that reification is induced by narrow perspectives and diminished by broadened perspectives. An ""authoritarian personality"" is not a prerequisite for such reification. But many of the characteristics of authoritarianism can result from this orientation toward social reality.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776926,American Journal of Sociology,10.2307_2776926,Sociology,1972.0,1,0.964066743850708,0,0.00020206798217259347,0,0.02048162743449211
,,,Creating Status Characteristics,"Status characteristics constitute significant elements of small group and societal stratification systems, and understanding their creation has theoretical and practical importance. We generalize Ridgeway's pathbreaking theory of status construction in three stages. First, we show that a conceptual change, using goal objects instead of exchangeable resources, permits us to explain the creation of many more status characteristics. Second, we explicate an interaction mechanism, behavior interchange patterns, that can transform other characteristics into status characteristics, even creating status differences where no characteristic is salient. Third, we show how new characteristics themselves can be created and given status value from deviance and personality attribution processes.

,,,Beyond Tokenism: The Making of Racially Diverse Feminist Organizations,"In the past 30 years, many white-dominated feminist organizations have struggled to achieve the goal of racial diversity. Research tells us that most have failed. We know much from the literature about the conflicts over race, class, and sexuality in feminist organizations, but little about whether it is possible to succeed in creating racially diverse organizations, and if so, how. In this article, I use qualitative data collected in the early 1990s to examine the process through which a battered women's shelter and a rape crisis center became racially diverse. Their stories elucidate the relationship between sustained ideological commitment, and structural opportunities and means that enabled feminists in two organizations to end long histories of white domination and to begin a new era of power and control in the hands of a racially diverse group of women. Because racial diversity has been a central yet often unmet goal within the feminist movement, it is important to understand the conditions of these anomalous successes.

Results show clear influence effects of educational attainment and mental illness but no effects for physical disability.

Married men, on the other hand, do not feel such a conflict and appear to be productive and happy. For women, divorce appears to be a liberation from the role conflict. Divorced women appear to be very productive and very involved in the student role, while divorced men have lost a source of psychological support and appear unhappy and less productive than their female counterparts.

The company does not manufacture material products; rather, value is produced through branding imported goods to promote 'alternative' ways of living. This is achieved through incorporation of leisure activities and lifestyles of key employees, effectively putting their 'lives' to 'work' in the creation of value for the company. For employees, therefore, much work actually takes place notionally outside or on the margins of their formally employed space and time. We argue that this qualitatively transforms the conceptions of, and relations between, work and life that underpin the concept of work/life balance.

Catch-up modernization of the less advanced member states is also an ""official"" goal of EU policy. Expert opinions about the prospects for success, however, vary widely. In this paper, a general model for how EU policy influences quality of life in less well-off member countries is presented. An analysis of former enlargements - the cohesion countries Ireland, Greece, Portugal, and Spain - reveals that EU integration obviously facilitates processes of catch up but does not guarantee them. This is demonstrated by using indicators covering different aspects of quality of life, per capita income (material living conditions), social protection ratios (general quality of society), and life satisfaction (subjective well-being).

,,,"The Limit of Equality Projects: Public-Sector Expansion, Sectoral Conflicts, and Income Inequality in Postindustrial Economies","In this study, we investigate how structural economic changes constrain an equality project, the public-sector expansion strategy. First, we describe a three-stage process in which a growing productivity gap between the private-manufacturing and public-service sectors disrupts traditional class solidarity. We contend that emerging conflicts between private and public sectors due to public-sector expansion and a growing inter-sectoral productivity gap eventually lead to employment and budget crises, as well as the weakening of coordinated wage-setting institutions. Furthermore, political, institutional, and economic transformations originating from sectoral cleavages and imbalance lead to increased income inequality. We test this argument using an unbalanced panel dataset on 16 advanced industrial democracies from 1971 to 2003. We find that public-sector employment has a strong negative effect on income inequality when the productivity gap between sectors is low. In such situations, public-sector employment fulfills its promise of equality and full employment. However, as the inter-sectoral productivity gap increases, the negative effect of public-sector expansion on income inequality evaporates. The findings suggest that severely uneven productivity gaps due to different degrees of technological innovations significantly weaken and limit the effectiveness of left-wing governments' policy interventions through public-service expansion.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25782182,American Sociological Review,10.2307_25782182,Sociology,2011.0,0,3.630598075687885e-05,0,0.005117747932672501,1,0.8493747711181641

The important work of, especially, Martha Nussbaum on the capabilities approach to evaluations of ""quality of life"" has highlighted pitfalls associated with the use of a narrow informational base in studies of women's lives and has emphasized the value of qualitative methods in these evaluations. However, to date, most discussions of the relevance of plural approaches to studies of women's lives have been conducted in the context of developing countries. This paper contributes a practical, current example of the relevance of such approaches to assessments of the lives of women in western countries as well. The research findings reported in the paper also cast further light on the importance of several, related themes in the literature on the capabilities approach, namely the importance of understanding how women's aspirations and expectations change with their economic and social experiences; and the importance of appreciating the social uses of language and how this affects the way in which women describe their lives.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/29770478,Review of Social Economy,10.2307_29770478,Sociology,2008.0,0,1.5055012227094267e-05,0,0.00018232817819807678,0,0.0003801729471888393
,,,FAMILY STRUCTURE AND SOCIAL CONTROL: A CROSS-CULTURAL STUDY,"It is usually suggested that the family gains control over the individual socialization and maintains control via covert social and psychological pressures based on the expectations internalized in the socialization process. Keying off LePlay's work, Zimmerman (1935) argues that control over the individual varies with the strength of the family and the strength of family is associated with other characteristics such as family size, form, homogeneity, etc. When these characteristics take on specific qualities the family is purported to have greater control. The works of LePlay, Zimmerman, and S.N. Eisenstadt suggest that when non-family agents of control such as political organizations, leadership positions, and police forces are dominant within the social structure the family is de-emphasized. The reverse is also true, i.e., when the family is the dominant agent of control, non-family agents are weak or non-existent. The data from Murdock and White's Standard Cross-Cultural Sample were used to test this suggested inverse relationship between family and non-family agents. The characteristics of the family were predicted to take on qualities conducive to control when non-family agents were weak and qualities not conducive to control when non-family agents were prevalent and dominant. Little support was found for the purported inverse relationship between family control and non-family control at the zero order. First order partials revealed strong support for the relationship and within the predicted categories of the control variables community size and technological specialization. A review of the percentages, however, reveals that it is not variation in family structure which accounts for the relationship but variation in the existence of non-family control agents.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23027139,International Journal of Sociology of the Family,10.2307_23027139,Sociology,1978.0,0,5.722692731069401e-05,1,0.9530326724052429,0,0.14183731377124786

Although there is little dispute that legal liability has expanded in this way, there is great dispute about the effect of these changes, particularly their costs, on public organizations in practice. Some observers argue that legalization has imposed heavy costs, especially financial costs, on organizations; others, for a variety of reasons, argue that these costs are likely to be exaggerated. In this article I suggest that organizational expenditures on legal services are likely to be a valid indicator of certain important elements of the costs of administrative legalization. I present the results of a study of the legal services expenditures of 13 major U.S. cities over a 35-year period.

,,,Exploratory Study on Drug Users' Perspectives on Quality of Life: More than Health-Related Quality of Life?,"In drug treatment outcome literature, a focus on objective and socially desirable indicators of change (e.g. no drug use) has predominated, whild outcome indicators that are important for drug users themselves (e.g. quality of life, satisfaction with treatment) have largely been neglected. Nonetheless, Quality of Life (QoL) has become an important concept to evaluate effectiveness of treatment in mental health care research and disability studies. Given the almost exclusive focus on Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in substance abuse research and the neglect of clients' perspectives in this field, we explore in this study the concept of QoL as perceived by drug users. Focus group discussions (n = 9) were organised in various treatment settings and community services for drug users in the region of Ghent, Belgium to identify important dimensions of QoL and their interpretation by drug users. Data were clustered and analysed based on the theoretical framework of Robert Schalock (Quality of life. Volume 1: Conceptualization and measurement, 1996). The domains 'personal relationships', 'social inclusion' and 'self-determination' were discussed most frequently by the participants. They stressed the importance of a supportive social network in particular. It can be concluded that QoL is not primarily associated by drug users with health and it involves much more than the aspects typically represented in measures of HRQOL.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27734774,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_27734774,Sociology,2009.0,0,1.2279563634365331e-05,1,0.9928332567214966,0,0.000857544771861285
,,,"The Meaning of Meanness: Popularity, Competition, and Conflict among Junior High School Girls","The ""dirty dozen"" was the name used by several teachers to refer to a clique of junior high school girls who were both mean and popular. In this school, the students used the term mean as a largely undifferentiated characterization for acts of commission and omission whose intent, or result, was to hurt someone emotionally. This article proposes that exploring the meaning of meanness is a starting point for understanding the connections between female competition, conflict, and popularity. An examination of these connections in the context of a clique of popular girls allows for a better understanding of the sociocultural construction of meanness in junior high school.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2673207,Sociology of Education,10.2307_2673207,Sociology,1997.0,1,0.9992559552192688,0,0.00017913042393047363,0,0.4003590941429138
,,,Compensation and the Social Structure of Misfortune,"This essay identifies social conditions associated with the compensatory style of conflict management, addresses variable aspects of compensation itself, and examines the modern trend toward a greater degree of compensatory liability of organizations for the misfortunes of individuals. Several propositions are discussed: Compensation is a direct function of groups and a curvilinear function of relational distance, and is greater in upward and group-directed cases than in downward and individual-directed cases. In addition, liability varies directly with social distance and is greater in group-directed than in individual-directed cases. The modern trend toward greater organizational liability appears to be a devolution toward a pattern of collective dependency characteristic of earlier societies before the decline of kinship.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3053596,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3053596,Sociology,1987.0,0,0.0002361416700296104,0,0.00019793794490396976,0,0.025448203086853027

,,,Measuring Social Indicators in Opinion Surveys: A Method to Improve Accuracy on Sensitive Questions,"Asking sensitive questions, without risking a terminated interview or response bias, is a major problem in deriving accurate social indicators based on public opinion surveys. This problem has become particularly acute as the topics that interest researchers have become more personal in nature. Mail and telephone surveys, and methods such as the randomized response technique, have all been used to try and overcome this problem, with varying degrees of success. In this paper, we describe an alternative approach using a sealed booklet. We report results from a question-format experiment that asked respondents the same sensitive questions in a sealed booklet, completed in the presence of the interviewer, and in a standard face-to-face interview. The survey used for the experiment was a personal interview survey of drug use based on a national population sample. The sealed booklet format was found to produce more accurate estimates of drug use compared to direct questions. In addition to assuring the respondent greater anonymity, the sealed booklet permits a wide range of questions to be asked and does not limit the analyses that can be conducted on the data.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27520950,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_27520950,Sociology,1992.0,0,0.0009911309462040663,0,0.00024001319252420217,0,0.0044026304967701435
,,,Preference for Men as Bosses and Professionals,"On the assumption that prejudice affects women's entry to male-dominated professional and management occupations, this paper investigates preferences for men as bosses and professionals (BPs). Using a sample (N = 1,402) of university staff and academic employees, we found that highly educated women and men who are highly educated or married to women employed as academics or professionals are least likely to prefer men BPs. Preference for male BPs was also affected by the number of female BPs respondents had dealt with professionally and by exposure to reportedly good or poor ones. These findings imply that legislative policies which help women to enter professional and managerial occupations may be successful despite prejudice against women.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2577601,Social Forces,10.2307_2577601,Sociology,1979.0,0,0.00019189715385437012,1,0.7701692581176758,1,0.998763918876648

,,,Examining Husband-Wife Differences in the Meaning of Family Financial Support,"The author examines the affective meanings (evaluation, potency, and activity) that seventy-eight heterosexual married or cohabiting couples attach to the act of financially supporting their family and finds that husbands consider their support more valuable and more active than their wives consider theirs. Using the couple as the unit of analysis, the author considers four hypotheses for these gender differences: job status, deviance neutralization, gender ideology, and gender display. Consistent with the job status hypotheses and inconsistent with the deviance neutralization hypotheses, the husband-wife differences in the evaluation and activity ratings become nonsignificant when spouses have the same job-related status (earnings, education, and work hours). Consistent with one gender ideology hypothesis, spouses evaluate their family breadwinning more similarly in couples with a liberal wife than they do in couples with a conservative wife. And consistent with a gender display hypothesis, conservative husbands who earn less than their conservative wives evaluate their breadwinning more positively than their wives evaluate theirs, suggesting that conservatives who deviate from gender norms in their relative earnings characterize their breadwinning in a way that neutralizes that deviance. Unexpectedly, the author also finds evidence of ""gender equalization"" among couples with a liberal wife: these spouses view their breadwinning somewhat similarly even when the husband's education exceeds the wife's, suggesting that liberals characterize their breadwinning in a way that neutralizes the deviance (for liberals) of traditional education differences.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sop.2008.51.1.63,Sociological Perspectives,10.1525_sop.2008.51.1.63,Sociology,2008.0,0,3.9084930904209614e-05,0,0.0007022931822575629,1,0.9851228594779968
