,,,CITYWARD MIGRATION AND URBAN FERTILITY IN THE PHILIPPINES,Studies of fertility differentials between native urbanites and rural migrants in developed countries usually show that the latter have higher fertility. That differentials of the same type are not necessarily found in a less developed country like the Philipines is demonstrated by a comparison of fertility levels of rural migrants originating in north-western Luzon and in Panay Island with those of native Manileños. A partial explanation of the relatively low fertility of Manila in-migrants is provided by the social-mobility theory which states that cityward migration is selective of persons with high-mobility aspirations and that migrants tend to participate in urban life — and consequently are exposed to its fertility-reducing tendencies — as least as much as native urbanites. Discrepancies between native-migrant fertility differentials found in the Philippines and in developed countries are reconciled by a theory of stages in the urbanization process.

I use findings of quantitative and qualitative studies to develop the idea that close friendships, wider networks of peers, and romantic relationships have distinct meanings and significance for the developing adolescent. Sociologists' work inevitably focuses attention on the ways in which the adolescent's social addresses and locations (gender, race, social class) influence many aspects of these early relationships. The review also highlights some limitations of the dominant perspective on adolescent relationships, attachment theory, and provides suggestions for future research (particularly in the area of romantic relationships, where the literature is growing but still relatively undeveloped).",https://www.jstor.org/stable/30036968,Annual Review of Sociology,10.2307_30036968,Sociology,2003.0,0,4.084994725417346e-05,1,0.836952805519104,1,0.8610424399375916

,,,Rapid Changes in Household Composition among Low Income Mothers,"Change in family structure over a 17 month period in a sample of 123 low-income urban and rural Wisconsin mothers who gave birth in 1974 is examined. One-third of the households changed household types as measured by presence or absence of male partner and/or extended family members. One-third of the mothers were heads of households at the study's outset; of these, two-thirds remained heads over the time period. Mother's age, education, and poverty status were characteristics most strongly related to household composition changes.

Academic restructuring may result in a closing of the status gap. This article, based on the responses of 600 PhD sociologists employed in applied, research, and policy positions, focuses on whether historically agreed upon professional characteristics, such as use of specialized knowledge, autonomy, ethical norms, and basic research, are related to overall job satisfaction and satisfaction with economic security. We expected that professional characteristics were significantly related to overall satisfaction, but not to satisfaction with economic security. Our expectations were generally met. Respondents used sociological theories, methods, and concepts to analyze social issues, design interventions, and evaluate solutions. Professional job characteristics result in higher job satisfaction, when other factors are held constant. In contrast, professional characteristics do not significantly increase satisfaction with economic security; rather sector, occupation, and age cohort appear to do so.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23548730,Journal of Applied Social Science,10.2307_23548730,Sociology,2007.0,0,0.001064806361682713,0,0.007014630828052759,1,0.8020340204238892

,,,Educational Stratification and Social Change: Evidence from German Unification,"This research examines educational stratification over the course of German unification. During this transition, eastern German states experienced rapid educational restructuring and expansion of the upper secondary curriculum in the context of dramatic macro-level changes. The analysis, based on German Social Survey (ALLBUS) data, explores educational inequality at the secondary-school level with respect to social origins over the course of unification, comparing four settings: the pre-unification German Democratic Republic and Federal Republic of Germany, and eastern and western states of a now-united Germany. Empirical findings suggest widespread similarities in educational inequality between East and West Germany among cohorts schooled in the 1980s.

Aside from varying operationalizations of religiosity, stressful life events and race/ethnicity may be important moderators of the impact of religiosity on mental health. Secondary data analyses on a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults reveal a curvilinear relation of religious service attendance on distress. Specifically, those reporting moderate levels of service attendance also report lower levels of distress than their counterparts.

,,,Women and Urbanization,"The article generalizes on the basis of two field studies conducted in slum areas (Ratmalana near Colombo in Sri Lanka and Khlong Toey in Bangkok, Thailand) by Susanne Thorbek, who has her doctorate in Cultural Sociology. The article introduces some reflections on the most fundamental changes as a result of urbanization, the radical separation between factory and family, between the social units which are responsible for the production of things (and value) and of human life. This separation has grave consequences for women (and thus also for men) it is argued, and it becomes manifest and more extensive with urbanization. This separation is the structural basis for the sharpened gender-struggle which develops in the cities, some outcomes of which are seen in terms of the changed definitions of the genders and their relationships, as well as the worldwide tendency to feminization of poverty. The impact of gender-struggle on women's work for incomes is discussed, a struggle which seems to be considerable since most women are dependent on men's networks or their relationship to individual men for access to reasonably paid work in both the registered firms and in most of the informal sector, or they are dependent on their male relatives' networks. Even in that part of the informal sector where they extend household chores into the market place (food, drinks, loans, small shops, prostitution), women are still partly dependent on such networks although the form may differ somewhat between the two areas. The forms and functions of families are likewise areas for gender-struggle and it is not only argued that city-life poses the extended and especially the women-centered family as a need for women but also that the cultural ramifications of gender-struggle have an important impact on the realization of such needs. The mothers without husbands are also discussed in this context. Finally, a few clues are given concerning the differences between the slum cultures and women's integration in these slum cultures. It is argued that either women's problems, that is problems with the production of life, are taken up as important topics by the whole slum culture, or women's problems are seen as their's alone, which then means that women become the problem in the slum culture. The study from Khlong Toey in Bangkok is published in ""Voices from the City"" (Zed Books 1987) and the other is forthcoming.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4200719,Acta Sociologica,10.2307_4200719,Sociology,1988.0,0,0.0001325096673099324,0,0.0004406337393447757,1,0.9891448616981506

,,,"Practices, Opportunity, and Protest Effectiveness: Illustrations from Four Animal Rights Campaigns","Despite its central role in the study of social movements, research on political and cultural opportunity is problematic. The vague definition and broad applicability of the concept of opportunity make it difficult to identify all the opportunities that exist in a given protest situation. Furthermore, most analyses take place at the broad levels of culture and the state, which can obscure additional localized factors that create opportunity for protest to occur and succeed. A practice-oriented approach to studying political and cultural opportunity addresses some of these problems.

,,,Blurring the Difference: The Politics of Identity in Northern Ireland,"The dominant interpretation of the sources of the conflict in Northern Ireland stresses the different national allegiances of Protestants (unionists) and Catholics (nationalists). As developed by the British and Irish governments on the one hand and many scholars on the other, the interpretation maintains that the identification of Protestants with Britain and of Catholics with Ireland is the main cause fostering the deep divisions on Northern Ireland. Exponents of this perspective – which is being called here the 'dual identity' approach – go on to prescribe constitutions for Northern Ireland that would allow both communities to express their identities and traditions. It is argued in this essay that this interpretation of Northern Irish politics is insufficient in explaining why Protestants have rejected several internal solutions that were meant to secure the union between Britain and Northern Ireland, which is their stated demand. The paper then suggests an alternative hypothesis: that Protestants also identify themselves as loyalists, that loyalism as an identity presumes and reinforces its opposite of disloyalism, and thus that in affirming their traditions, Protestants also accentuate the conflict with Catholics. The source of the conflict is not, then, just separate and distinct national identities, but the interaction of communal identities that presume and deny each other.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/44461166,South African Sociological Review,10.2307_44461166,Sociology,1990.0,0,0.046814605593681335,1,0.9991356730461121,0,0.018214311450719833

Throughout the Middle East, it long served as a major instrument for delivering public goods in a decentralized manner. In principle, the manager of a waqf had to obey the stipulations of its founder to the letter. In practice, the founder's directives were often circumvented. An unintended consequence was an erosion of the waqf system's legitimacy. In any case, legally questionable adaptations proved no substitute for the legitimate options available to corporations. As it became increasingly clear that the waqf system lacked the flexibility necessary for efficient resource utilization, governments found it ever easier to confiscate their resources. In the 19th century, the founding of European-inspired municipalities marked a formal repudiation of the waqf system in favor of government-coordinated systems for delivering public goods.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3185418,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3185418,Sociology,2001.0,0,0.15770237147808075,0,0.00042009836761280894,0,3.261661549913697e-05

In a role-play vignette study we asked 320 college students to take the position of a subordinate in a conflict with a manager, and to evaluate their own likelihood of adopting six options suggested by Bacharach and Lawler's analysis of dependence and tactial choice and by Zelditch and Walker's legitimacy approach to stability: threat to leave, coalition with other subordinates, appealing to a higher authority, appealing to a higher authority in a coalition, persuasion, and conflict avoidance. The factorial design manipulated subordinates' and superordinates' alternatives, as well as endorsement and authorization of the superordinate. Results generally support our predictions on the relationships between dependence and legitimacy dimensions on the one hand, and specific tactical evaluations on the other. They show that threat to leave is relted directly to self and other alternatives, while evaluations of coalition formation, appeal to a higher authority, and a combination of these two tactics are related directly to the legitimacy dimensions. Evaluations of conflict avoidance are related directly to both dependence and legitimacy: persuasion is viewed as a more likely option regardless of variation in the depedence and legitimacy dimensions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2787047,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_2787047,Sociology,1996.0,0,0.1616583913564682,0,0.00012483465252444148,0,0.00019803119357675314

Pluralism has this effect because it facilitates the acquisition of appropriate medical facilities and because it tends to optimize the biological functioning of the residents. Working from a major component of pluralism, minority participation, this hypothesis is tested by showing that women's status in less developed countries improves life expectancy net of controls. A path analysis demonstrates that the structural dimensions work through health organization as an intervening variable, and the future testing of biological optimization is outlined.

This result may be due to the fact that these communities are less likely to coordinate to create solidarity across ethnic groups and demand stronger enforcement.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/29770388,Review of Social Economy,10.2307_29770388,Sociology,2006.0,0,2.0846709958277643e-05,0,0.00018205458763986826,1,0.9998140931129456
,,,Child Support in Black and White: Racial Differentials in the Award and Receipt of Child Support during the 1980s,"Objective. Black mothers living with own children whose fathers reside elsewhere are far less likely than white mothers to have a child support award and to receive payments due them. The purpose of this paper is to explain these large racial differentials in child support. Methods. This research analyzes data from the first four child support supplements to the Current Population Survey, 1979-86, to assess to what extent racial differentials in awards and receipts can be explained by racial differences in parental characteristics. Results. Racial differentials in award rates can be fully explained by the higher incidence of out-of-wedlock births among black mothers and the lower incomes of black men. By contrast, racial differentials in receipt rates and amounts are not fully explained by these and other socioeconomic factors. Conclusions. Unexplained differentials in child support receipts result from behavioral differences by race and perhaps from unequal treatment by or access to the child support system. Increased resources by state child support enforcement offices directed towards black mothers may well be warranted.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42863500,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42863500,Sociology,1996.0,0,1.036464800563408e-05,0,0.026607085019350052,1,0.9981114864349365
,,,Why the Poor Play the Lottery: Sociological Approaches to Explaining Class-based Lottery Play,"Why do the poor spend more on lottery tickets than their wealthier and better educated peers? While social scientists generally agree that there is an inverse relationship between socio-economic position and patterns of lottery play, there is debate on what factors cause lottery gambling. Using survey data from a nationwide probability sample, we test three sociological approaches – socio-structural, cultural and social network accounts – to explain why the poor play the lottery. While controlling for cognitive bias theory, we find that peer play, educational attainment and self-perceived social deprivation have strong effects on lottery play. Culture, the study finds, plays a much lesser role. Although lottery players demonstrate fatalistic value orientations, it is not a lack of a 'Protestant' work ethic that makes the poor spend proportionally more on lottery tickets. The findings of this study generally point to the importance of social structures in explaining lottery gambling.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24433691,Sociology,10.2307_24433691,Sociology,2013.0,0,0.0008290309342555702,1,0.9790961742401123,1,0.8276422023773193

,,,Gender remix: On gender constructions among children of immigrants in Norway,"Values and practices regarding sex and gender are among the most fundamental constituents of a society's symbolic system, as well as of an individual's self. Gendered ways of behavior are symbolic markers of ethnicity, both in a process of labeling from the outside and in the construction of a subjective identity. Based on interviews with children of immigrants from patriarchal societies living in Norway — one of the countries in the world where gender equality has reached furthest — the article reveals the tension they experience between the ways gender issues are dealt with in their families and in the surrounding society. Their gender constructions can not be understood solely in the light of cultural influence, as if on a scale running from conformity to parents' culture to conformity to Norwegian culture. There is something really new in the making — new combinations and new creations — reflecting the particular social situation of the young people of immigrant origin. Feelings of obligations and debt toward the parents are strong, as well as the adherence to traditional family values. Still, there is clearly a tendency that ideas about individual rights, such as women's and children's rights to decide over their lives, are gaining influence.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23889941,Ethnicities,10.2307_23889941,Sociology,2002.0,1,0.9769807457923889,0,0.00022892166452948004,1,0.9876074194908142
,,,PREMARITAL SEX: ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR BY DATING STAGE,"Using data gathered from a sixty-three item dating and mate-selection questionnaire completed by two hundred and eighty student and nonstudent respondents, this study investigates the differences between what people believe is proper premarital sexual behavior, what they do and what they think others are doing at five stages of dating. We find that individuals are most restrictive in what they believe is proper conduct, more permissive in their reported behavior and most permissive in their perception of what others are doing. During the early stages of dating, males and females differ widely in their outlook as to what is proper behavior and also in their reported behavior. Other studies which failed to take dating stage into consideration may have missed important gender differences in the early period of dating. With love and commitment the attitudes and reported behavior of females becomes as permissive as those of males. This is true for light petting, heavy petting and intercourse. Only with regard to oral sex do we still find significant differences between males and females even in the latter stages of dating. In addition to gender, this study examines the influence of the following factors on premarital sexual attitudes and behavior: age, father's education, mother's education, college status, residence, religion, nationality, attendance at religious services and religiosity. Only the last two variables are found to be statistically significant. Frequent attendance at religious services and holding religious beliefs to be important were associated with more conservative sexual attitudes and behavior. In sum, we find that in our analysis of social factors only religious and gender-role socialization affect premarital sexual attitudes and behavior. The latter'a influence varies significantly by dating stage. Lastly, we find that a majority of our respondents (71 percent of the males and 66 percent of the females) verbally support cohabitation, and a substantial minority (24 percent of the male and 18 percent of the females) have lived with someone of the opposite sex. The results of this study suggest that the liberalization of premarital sexual attitudes and behavior documented by numerous studies in the 1960s and 1970s shows no sign of abatement in the 1980s.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41430916,International Journal of Sociology of the Family,10.2307_41430916,Sociology,1984.0,0,0.0016679076943546534,0,0.00018615988665260375,1,0.9568935036659241

,,,WOMEN'S SOCIAL CLASS IDENTIFICATION: DOES HUSBAND'S OCCUPATION MAKE A DIFFERENCE?,"Research into social stratification has tended to concentrate on working-class men; there has been little on the middle classes, and even less on women. This paper looks at the class position and class images of 342 working married women in social grade Cl, drawn from a national survey of class images conducted between 1981 and 1984, to assess the extent to which these women's class identification is determined by the occupation of their husbands and the way in which the middle and working classes are perceived by women in same-class and cross-class marriages. It is concluded that a woman's class identification is determined at least in part by her own characteristics rather than her husband's, with education being a particularly important variable.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42854386,Sociology,10.2307_42854386,Sociology,1987.0,0,0.008042175322771072,0,0.4963168501853943,1,0.999395489692688
,,,Meat as a Bad Habit: A Case for Positive Feedback in Consumption Preferences Leading to Lock-in,"The concepts of path dependence and lock-in have received growing acceptance but have generally been thought of as driven by positive feedback on the supply side of the economy. A case through example is made here of how endogenous preferences positive feedback in utility from consumption, social considerations, and institutional considerations can all lead to path dependence and the persistence of suboptimal consumption choices. The case here specifically relates to meat consumption and utilizes behavioral, institutional, as well as neoclassical approaches to justify the conclusion. It is argued that increased meat consumption, which at one time may have had positive value, has developed increasingly negative consequences both at the individual and social level. Negative impacts include health consequences, low production efficiency, and environmental damage, among others. Nevertheless, preferences for meat are maintained by multiple factors including historical dependence of tastes, socially established meanings of consumption choices, and institutional inertia.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/29770418,Review of Social Economy,10.2307_29770418,Sociology,2007.0,0,0.364230215549469,0,0.004481086507439613,0,0.0024427350144833326

,,,"Silence, Death, and the Invisible Enemy: AIDS Activism and Social Movement ""Newness""","Examining the dynamics and activities of the AIDS activist movement--here, through an analysis based on a participant-observation study of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) in San Francisco--provides an opportunity to clarify issues on which social movements literature tends to be hazy. ACT UP mixes strategic action and material targets with expressive action and cultural targets; their cultural activity takes the form of boundary-crossing and the contesting of images. They often have difficulty distinguishing their targets, and are caught both denying and affirming that AIDS is a gay disease. I argue that these actions and dilemmas are best understood in the context of changed forms of domination, more and more an invisible and disembodied process of ""normalization,"" with the state gradually less directly involved. This argument not only explains the particulars of ACT UP's activism, but also poses challenges to theorizing on contemporary (""new"") social movements.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/800820,Social Problems,10.2307_800820,Sociology,1989.0,1,0.9987855553627014,0,0.00026336961309425533,0,0.0014532966306433082
,,,Wangari Maathai and Kenya's Green Belt Movement: Exploring the Evolution and Potentialities of Consensus Movement Mobilization,"Social movement research has traditionally focused on conflictual, overtly confrontational approaches to addressing social problems. Consensus movements, such as grassroots self-help movements in the countries of the South, have only recently been studied. Whereas some of these movements employ contentious strategies to influence traditional political arenas and actors, others intentionally remain outside traditional political spheres and use consensual means to achieve their social change objectives. Utilizing Kenya's Green Belt Movement as an example, I argue that consensus strategies present opportunities for movement formation and development in repressive environments. Likewise, the domestic momentum and international exposure generated from consensus action can provide future opportunities for expanding the movement's tactical repertoire.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3096988,Social Problems,10.2307_3096988,Sociology,1994.0,0,0.039555806666612625,0,0.0016258514951914549,0,0.0004476163594517857

The practitioner has to encourage and enable participation in the investigation in an appropriate fashion while preserving the structure and integrity of the procedure. In this article, we consider optometry and the deployment of a vision test, known as subject refraction, that provides data to help determine the characteristics of any corrective lens that may be required by clients. The procedure's ability to establish robust and reliable data relies upon the optometrist's ability to encourage the client to respond to a series of stimuli without consideration or reflection. That is, the client is required to produce an unwitting response—conduct that might be considered nonsymbolic rather than symbolic. In this article, we also consider the optometrist's talk and bodily comportment during subjective refraction and how it serves to shape and determine the quality of the client's response and participation, and in turn to produce reliable test results.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/symbinte.36.2.137,Symbolic Interaction,10.2307_symbinte.36.2.137,Sociology,2013.0,0,0.00022726102906744927,0,0.0028045279905200005,0,0.0001990762393688783
