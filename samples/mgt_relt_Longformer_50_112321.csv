,,,Configurations Revisited,"My 1986 article in SMJ represented an early attempt to apply the approach of configuration to the field of strategy. Now, 10 years later, we still have far to go. What is often lacking from the configurational literature is the search for configuration itself: for complex systems of interdependency and their core orchestrating themes. In this note I address the two major approaches to configuration: conceptually derived typologies and empirically based taxonomies. Some shortcomings of this work are identified and a few ambitious remedial suggestions are advanced. I then propose a third approach-studying configuration as a variable or quality within each organization that can create or destroy competitive advantage.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486729,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_2486729,Management & Organizational Behavior,1996.0,0,0.001094156177714467,1,0.9999752044677734,0,0.001912906183861196

,,,After-Effects of Job-Related Stress: Families as Victims,"In recent years, the unique stress experienced by those who do `people work' has been acknowledged by the helping professions as a widespread problem and has been recognized by social scientists as a topic requiring systematic research. This paper begins by briefly reviewing research on the type of job stress experienced by workers in the helping professions. Then, a study of 142 police couples is reported, illustrating the effects of job stress on family life. In a survey study, police officers and their wives described family interactions. Officers who were experiencing stress, as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory, were more likely to display anger, spend time off away from the family, be uninvolved in family matters, and to have unsatisfactory marriages. An examination of the coping patterns used to deal with the stress of police work highlights differences between coping strategies used by husbands versus wives.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3000298,Journal of Occupational Behaviour,10.2307_3000298,Management & Organizational Behavior,1982.0,0,1.947576856764499e-05,1,0.9992474317550659,0,0.0667526051402092

,,,Thirty Years after Michael E. Porter: What Do We Know about Business Exit?,"Although a business exit is an important corporate change initiative, the buyer's side seems to be more appealing to management researchers than the seller's because acquisitions imply growth, i.e., success. Yet from an optimistic viewpoint, business exit can effectively create value for the selling company. In this paper we attempt to bring the relevance of the seller's side back into our consciousness by asking: What do we know about business exit? We start our exploration with Porter (1976), focusing on literature that investigates the antecedents of, barriers to, and outcomes of business exit. We also include studies from related fields such as finance and economics. Through this research we determine three clusters of findings: factors promoting business exit, exit barriers, and exit outcomes. Overall, it is the intention of this paper to highlight the importance of business exit for research and practice. Knowing what we know about business exits and their high financial value we should bear in mind that exit need not mean failure but a new beginning for a corporation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27747372,Academy of Management Perspectives,10.2307_27747372,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,0,5.557466283789836e-05,1,0.9852398633956909,0,0.0017701723845675588

,,,Competition in a Multimarket Environment: The Case of Market Exit,"Studies of competition typically have two underlying assumptions: that competition occurs within the boundaries of industries or markets and that all firms in a market or industry are affected equally by competitive pressures. The concept of multipoint competition challenges both assumptions. Multipoint theory addresses how different levels of contact between firms across multiple markets affect competition in individual markets. Its main argument is that high levels of contact between firms across markets will induce mutual forbearance, causing multipoint competitors to refrain from aggressively attacking each other. The restraint stems from the fact that high levels of intermarket contact enable a firm to respond to an aggressive action by a multipoint rival in markets other than the one in which the action takes place. That possibility raises the potential costs of aggressive moves and serves as a credible deterrent, especially if a firm can respond in several markets. In addition, multipoint competition helps firms to interpret their rivals' intentions and signal their own, reducing the likelihood of costly misunderstandings. The authors elaborate on those ideas to examine how a hospital's degree of intermarket contact with its competitors in a particular service market affects the likelihood that it will exit that market. They find that hospitals are less likely to exit markets in which they meet large numbers of their multipoint rivals. As a result of mutual forbearance, competitive rivalry is reduced across the markets that multipoint rivals share, lessening the types of pressures that typically prompt market exit. With lower levels of competitive rivalry, markets shared by multipoint rivals are relatively more hospitable environments in which to operate and are less likely to be exited. Rather than competing intensely, multipoint rivals appear to adopt a ""live and let live"" approach toward each other. The fact that multipoint contact across markets may lessen competitive pressures within individual markets has implications for the contact between firms in several settings. Multimarket contact can occur across different product or service markets and also across different geographic markets, thus affording an intriguing perspective for the investigation of the rivalry between emerging transnational firms. True transnationals, by successfully integrating global operations while still addressing local market concerns, have been seen by some as having the capabilities necessary for successful performance in international competition. Perhaps transnational firms, because they have an integrated decision-making structure, can coordinate their actions to reduce competitive rivalry with each other across the markets they share. If so, markets dominated by transnationals may become more stable than the current state of international competition would predict.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635306,Organization Science,10.2307_2635306,Management & Organizational Behavior,1997.0,0,0.001351971528492868,1,0.9584038257598877,1,0.9995865225791931
,,,"Tourism sustainability, resiliency and dynamics: Towards a more comprehensive perspective","This paper uses insights from a basic but formal model of tourism dynamics to frame a discussion of sustainability in tourism planning, with a particular focus on the role of dynamic resilience — or the ability of social, economic or ecological systems to recover from tourism-induced stress. The paper presents a theoretical approach to model resiliency in the ecological-environmental quality, economic-fiscal quality and social-cultural quality of tourist destinations. The model also formalises the difference between actual and perceived changes in these vectors. The specific goals of the paper are to characterise a more quantitative approach towards tourism sustainability and resilience, to summarise results in the tourism literature that might contribute to initial empirical implementation of such quantitative models, and to stimulate debate regarding the potential role of such approaches in guiding tourism policy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23746749,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23746749,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,0,2.1968842702335678e-05,1,0.9940713047981262,0,0.0003342132258694619
,,,Does Business School Research Add Economic Value for Students?,"The scholarly research conducted by business school faculty has long been the subject of intense criticism for lacking relevance and value to practice. In contrast, we theorize that such research is relevant and valuable in that it contributes to what is arguably the most critical metric of relevance for business school students: the economic value they accrue from their education. We investigate this counterargument on a sample of 658 business schools over an 8-year period. We find that research adds significant value in that it can potentially enhance student salaries by up to $24,000 per year. However, we also observe that ""excessive"" research activity can lead to diminishing or even negative returns for students, and a research focus solely on elite journals might rob students of the benefits of exposure to a broader array of new ideas.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25782051,Academy of Management Learning & Education,10.2307_25782051,Management & Organizational Behavior,2010.0,0,1.905165299831424e-05,1,0.9920180439949036,0,0.00015408881881739944

,,,Are Two Heads Better Than One?,"The leadership of a board, including active participation in the selection of board members and the CEO, is the responsibility of the Chairman. The job of putting together an effective board and developing it as a team is an onerous one, and should not be coupled with the job of actively leading management; the positions of Chairman and CEO should not be combined except in very unusual circumstances. Vital to the division of the two jobs, however, are several conditions: the respective roles of Chairman, board and CEO must be clearly defined and understood; there must be a high degree of mutual respect and understanding between the Chairman and the CEO; the board must feel involved in the operation and have a stake in its success; and the whole process must be layered with communication of the highest order.

We also assume that replenishment quantities at both echelons can be adjusted up to the time of delivery, resulting in replenishment lead times equal to zero.

,,,A study of the perceptions of the labour market by human resource managers in the UK hotel industry: A cognitive approach,"It is reasonable to assume that if the labour market is the dominant force in labour management then the significance of the role of the human resource manager lies in the position it holds at the intersection between the external and the internal market, with recruitment as the joining process. This paper describes a qualitative investigation of hotel human resource managers' perceptions of their labour market environment using the process of recruitment as a vehicle to explore cognitive processes. A cognitive task analysis was completed which utilised four interview methods: task diagram; knowledge audit; simulation interview; and repertory grid. The findings show that the HR managers conform to the appellation of 'expert' in that they would use few and simple rules in making decisions. They also assume that the labour market will always provide and that perceptions of what goes on inside the organisation are quite separate.

This article investigates the organizational means that describe how new staff members are connected to others in the firm. The choices that a firm makes in this matter are theorized to influence subsequent socialization outcomes such as performance, organizational commitment, job involvement and turnover intentions. For these purposes, the six dichotomies from Van Maanen and Schein (1979) were explored in a professional work context. Structural equations modeling was used to test a group of interconnected hypotheses. The results indicate that four of these six organizing conditions affect at least, one socialization outcome. The single most important organizational choice proved to be whether the firm confirms or disconfirms the values held by the incoming accountant. These results indicate that how accounting firms choose to arrange the early experiences of their staff will have important consequences for the professional services firm.

The Challenges of Being an Organisational Change Agent for Sustainability,"There are a handful of people inside organisations who are the initiators and champions of sustainable development, and they come in a variety of guises. They may be volunteers who have taken on this role unprompted because of their interest and commitment. They may have environmental management, energy efficiency or social impacts as part of their job. They may be in a strategic role, or in a communications team. They may be relatively senior in their organisation. They may have operational or core-business roles, or they may be in a separate expert team. This article looks at organisational change for sustainability from their perspective, exploring the tensions which make this change challenge particularly stretching. These tensions are over and above the usual challenges and choices which face organisational change-makers in other situations, and they are related to the sustainable development change agent's self-perception as being part of a wider sustainability change movement. The survey shows that: (1) they think change isn't happening fast enough and isn't ambitious enough; (2) it is hard to find genuine win–wins which meet organisational needs as well as sustainability goals; and (3) they recognise that emergent, systemic change is needed but struggle to reconcile this with the need for tangible short-term progress and measurable goals.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/greemanainte.57.9,Greener Management International,10.2307_greemanainte.57.9,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,0,0.00018950898083858192,0,0.00023118550598155707,0,0.004772521555423737

Yet research also suggests that new media afford people additional flexibility and control by enabling them to communicate from anywhere at any time. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data, this paper builds theory that unravels this apparent contradiction. As the literature would predict, we found that the more time people spent handling e-mail, the greater was their sense of being overloaded, and the more e-mail they processed, the greater their perceived ability to cope. Contrary to assumptions of prior studies, we found no evidence that time spent working mediates e-mail-related overload. Instead, e-mail's material properties entwined with social norms and interpretations in a way that led informants to single out e-mail as a cultural symbol of the overload they experience in their lives. Moreover, by serving as a symbol, e-mail distracted people from recognizing other sources of overload in their work lives.

Furthermore, the data revealed that attitude towards competency management was more positive and perceived behavioral control was higher when competency management was implemented with a commitment instead of a control approach.

Here, the aspiring imitator faces a knowledge (i.e., ""capabilities-based"") barrier to imitation that is both causal and ambiguous in a precise sense of both words. Imitation conforms to a well-explicated process of learning by observing. I provide a precise distinction between the intrinsic causal ambiguity associated with a particular strategy and the subjective ambiguity perceived by a challenger. I find that intrinsic ambiguity is a necessary but insufficient condition for a sustained capability-based advantage. I also demonstrate that combinatorial complexity, a phenomenon that has attracted the recent attention of strategy theorists, and causal ambiguity are distinct barriers to imitation. The former acts as a barrier to explorative/active learning and the latter as one to absorptive/passive learning. One implication of this is that learning by doing and learning by observing are complementary strategic activities, not substitutes—in most cases, we should expect firm strategies to seek performance enhancement using efforts of both types.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40539155,Management Science,10.2307_40539155,Management & Organizational Behavior,2009.0,0,0.001304212142713368,0,0.004860640969127417,0,0.00013004311767872423
,,,The UK National Lottery and the Arts: Reflections on the Lottery's Impact and Development,"The launch of the UK's first national lottery of modern times in 1994 represented the country's most significant change in public funding for the arts since World War II . This paper presents a brief overview of the National Lottery and the distribution system that channels proceeds to its various ""good causes."" It then reviews the Lottery's funding for the arts, distinguishing between capital grants (for construction, investment and film production) and revenue funding programs. It sets these revenue programs within the context of the Arts Council of England's grant-in-aid (publicly funded) revenue spending plans. The final sections of the paper consider the reforms to the National Lottery resulting from the National Lottery Act of 1998, together with the results of the Departmental Spending Review of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which set out grant-in-aid plans for the arts for the 3 financial years ending in 2002. Au Royaume-Uni, le lancement de la première loterie nationale des temps modernes, en 1994, constitue le changement le plus significatif apporté au financement public des arts depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale. L'article donne une vue d'ensemble du contexte et des caractéristiques de la loterie nationale et décrit brièvement le mode de distribution des recettes, qui sont canalisées vers différentes « bonnes causes ». Les auteurs examinent ensuite le financement des arts en particulier, en distinguant entre les subventions pour des projets matériels (construction, équipements et production cinématographique) et les subventions de fonctionnement. Ils situent ces dernières dans le cadre des projets d'aide financière (fonds publics) du Conseil des arts d'Angleterre. Enfin, ils examinent les modifications apportées à la loterie nationale après l'adoption de la National Lottery Act (1998), ainsi que les conclusions de l'étude sur ses dépenses menée par le ministère de la Culture, des Médias et des Sports, où figurent les plans d'aide financière aux arts pour les trois exercices se terminant en 2002. El lanzamiento de la primera lotería naáonal del Reino Unido en 1994 representó el cambio más significativo en los fondos públicos para las artes desde la 2da Guerra Mundial.

An engaged community offers unrealized opportunity for maximizing return-on-public-dollar investment. Specifically, local governments that are committed to community and improvements to quality of life are more likely to successfully transform citizens into active participants in community development. At the same time, local governments that unselfishly focus on the will of the community will also reap returns in the form of improved citizen-government relations.

,,,R & D Project Selection and Manpower Allocation with Integer Nonlinear Goal Programming,"A number of recent research efforts in the area of research and development planning have indicated the necessity that the R & D project selection process be viewed as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. As a result, linear 0-1 goal programming, because of its ability to encompass multiple objectives, has been employed on several occasions as a project selection model. However, in these goal programming models the relationships between resource utilization and project outcomes or between various resource utilizations have been expressed linearly when, in reality, they are often non-linear. For example, as the resources allocated to a project are increased the probability of project success will also increase but at a decreasing rate. In this paper, a non-linear integer goal programming model is described via a case example. The case example encompasses a pool of thirty researchers available for allocation to seven possible R & D projects. As such, the model consists of integer decision variables for both the number of researchers allocated, and, project selection. Researcher allocation and project selection are subject to several linear and nonlinear goal constraints. Nonlinear goal constraints are constructed that relate the probability of project success to the number of researchers assigned to a project and to expected monetary return, and, that relate the number of researchers allocated to project completion time. Linear goal constraints are developed for budget limitations, computer capacity utilization and various strict conditions placed on the model. The model selects projects and allocates researchers to projects such that a prioritized goal structure is most satisfactorily achieved. The model solution of the case example indicated the selection of five of the seven projects and the number of researchers assigned to each project. Of the nine prioritized goals, six were achieved while three were only partially achieved.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2630943,Management Science,10.2307_2630943,Management & Organizational Behavior,1982.0,0,1.3055770068604033e-05,1,0.9995957016944885,0,0.0023091675247997046

Findings have revealed various change patterns where developments regarding different dimensions of work life follow different logics: If employment becomes less secure, job security becomes more important.

Tobin's q is used to measure management's inclination to invest in negative NPV investments.

Alternatively, hostile bidders' past investment decisions have increased shareholder wealth. Furthermore, white knights' returns upon the announcement of their bid have a significant negative relationship with free cash flow, implying that their bid reveals information about white knights management's investment decisions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108146,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_3108146,Management & Organizational Behavior,1999.0,0,1.0244279110338539e-05,1,0.999789297580719,0,0.0001290882210014388
,,,Online Auction and List Price Revenue Management,"We analyze a revenue management problem in which a seller facing a Poisson arrival stream of consumers operates an online multiunit auction. Consumers can get the product from an alternative list price channel. We consider two variants of this problem: In the first variant, the list price is an external channel run by another firm. In the second one, the seller manages both the auction and the list price channels. Each consumer, trying to maximize his own surplus, must decide either to buy at the posted price and get the item at no risk, or to join the auction and wait until its end, when the winners are revealed and the auction price is disclosed. Our approach consists of two parts. First, we study structural properties of the problem, and show that the equilibrium strategy for both versions of this game is of the threshold type, meaning that a consumer will join the auction only if his arrival time is above a function of his own valuation. This consumer's strategy can be computed using an iterative algorithm in a function space, provably convergent under some conditions. Unfortunately, this procedure is computationally intensive. Second, and to overcome this limitation, we formulate an asymptotic version of the problem, in which the demand rate and the initial number of units grow proportionally large. We obtain a simple closed-form expression for the equilibrium strategy in this regime, which is then used as an approximate solution to the original problem. Numerical computations show that this heuristic is very accurate. The asymptotic solution culminates in simple and precise recipes of how bidders should behave, as well as how the seller should structure the auction, and price the product in the dual-channel case.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20110741,Management Science,10.2307_20110741,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,0,1.1692300176946446e-05,1,0.9908084273338318,0,6.276098429225385e-05

It is based on a sample of 50 Texas manufacturers. Cluster analysis yielded five distinct groups-two innovative and three noninnovative. The two innovative groups were either young firms dubbed the ""Young Turks"", or, established, managerially competent firms headed by newcomers called the ""Blue Chips"". Among the three noninnovative groups, the ""Silver Spoons"" appeared to be surviving on past success; the ""Striving Stoics"" displayed continuing managerial effort but were led by executives who had been at the helm far longer than average; and the ""Kismets"" showed lesser competence and effort, were highly centralized, and were headed by executives tending more towards an external locus of control. Correlational analysis indicated a significant positive relationship between scanning and innovation. Challenges to the firm in the form of environmental dynamism and heterogeneity evoked positive innovatory responses but environmental hostility was a weak negative correlate inducing the firm to ""pull in its horns"".

,,,Impact of Underlying Demand and Agglomeration of Supply on Seasonally: The Case of the Hollywood Film Industry,"The authors argue that it is possible to break the demand for films into two types: the underlying demand accounted for by audiences' behaviours owing to events outside the film industry (vacations, climate, etc.); and demand due to the agglomeration of supply by studios due to release dates selected close to each other. To ensure the success of their films, movie studios exploit peaks in demand. Such agglomeration increases seasonality and could lead studios to overestimate the true level of underlying demand at particular times. The aim of this article is to isolate the underlying demand in order to assess studios' choices in terms of release dates. The authors show that two periods - the beginning of the year and summer - are underutilized, with the release of fewer films than the market is able to absorb, while two other periods - spring and year's end - are overexploited. The choice of release date based on this criterion is a good predictor of a film's performance. Cet article soutient qu'il est possible de décomposer la demande pour les films en deux types : la demande sous-jacente imputable au comportement des spectateurs lié à des événements extérieurs à l'industrie cinématographique (vacances, climat, etc.) et la demande existante liée à la concentration de l'offre des studios au moyen de dates de sortie rapprochées. En effet, afin d'assurer le succès de leur film, ceux-ci cherchent à exploiter les pics de demande. Cette concentration accroît la saisonnalité et peut conduire les studios à surestimer le niveau réel de la demande sous-jacente de certaines périodes. L'objectif de cet article est donc d'isoler la demande sous-jacente afin de pouvoir juger les choix des studios en matière de dates de sortie. Il apparaît alors que deux périodes, le début d'année et l'été, s'avèrent sous-exploitées, c'est-à-dire accueillant moins de films que le marché pourrait en absorber, alors que deux autres, le printemps et la fin de l'année, sont surexploitées. Le choix de la date de sortie à partir de ce critère apparaît ainsi comme un prédicteur de la performance d'un film. Se afirma en este articulo que la demanda fílmica puede desglosarse en dos tipos: la demanda subyacente en respuesta al comportamiento de los espectadores influenciado por eventos fuera de la industria cinematográfica (vacaciones, clima, etc.) y la demanda suscitada por la concentración de la oferta alrededor de las fechas de estreno anunciadas por los estudios de cine. De hecho, para asegurarse del éxito de sus películas, éstos tratan de aprovechar los picos de la demanda. Dicha concentración aumenta el carácter estacional de la oferta y puede hacer que los estudios sobrevaluen el nivel real de la demanda subyacente de ciertos periodos. En este artículo se pretende, por ende, aislar esta última con miras a determinar con qué acierto los estudios escogen las fechas de estreno de sus películas. Se observa una subutilización de dos periodos, el principio del año y del verano, es decir momentos en los cuales el mercado podría soportar mayor número de películas en cartelera, al mismo tiempo que se sobreexplotan la primavera y el fin de año. Se concluye que la decisión sobre la fecha de estreno puede ser un buen indicador del desempeño de una película.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41721123,International Journal of Arts Management,10.2307_41721123,Management & Organizational Behavior,2012.0,0,2.865714304789435e-05,1,0.9478458166122437,0,0.0004834721621591598

Possible reasons for the lack of difference are identified including the nature of the networks and the way in which knowledge is exchanged and retained among businesses.

,,,"Chief Mohlomi: A Pioneer in Bridging Knowledge from Enterprises of Science, Business and Politics in Southern Africa in the 18th Century","The growth and specialization in knowledge production from enterprises of knowledge in the 20th century has led to a major diffraction of the intellectual terrain and a growing distance between knowledge boundaries. It is in this regard that the need to build bridges between various sources of knowledge has become more urgent than ever before. Is this gap worth filling? The answer is a resounding, yes, for a variety of reasons from a responsible leadership viewpoint: first, to generate understanding of leadership responsibilities needed for human progress and development between and across enterprises of knowledge; and second, to create a dialogue about crucial multi-disciplinary insights and knowledge needed to tackle complex development issues facing humanity. Drawing on lessons largely from southern Africa in the 18th century, the paper presents Chief Mohlomi as a pioneer in applying a unity of knowledge approach regarding the enterprise of science, business and of politics for human progress and development.

,,,A Methodology for Collective Evaluation and Selection of Industrial R&D Projects,"This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating and selecting R&D projects in a collective decision setting, especially useful at sectorial and national levels. It consists of two major phases: Evaluation and Selection. The evaluation process repeatedly uses mathematical programming models to determine the ""relative values"" of a given R&D project from the viewpoint of the other R&D projects. The selection process of R&D projects is based on these ""relative values"" and is done through a model-based outranking method. The salient features of the methodology developed are its ability to (1) permit the evaluation of an R&D project from the viewpoint of the other R&D projects without at first imposing a uniform evaluation scheme, and (2) maximize the level of consensus as to which projects should not be retained in the R&D Program being funded, thus minimizing the level of possible resentment in those organizations or departments whose projects are not included in the R&D Program. Also discussed in this paper is an application of the methodology to evaluate and select major R&D projects in the iron and steel industry of Turkey.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2632540,Management Science,10.2307_2632540,Management & Organizational Behavior,1991.0,0,9.524113920633681e-06,1,0.9835451245307922,0,0.00019756612891796976

,,,Marketing Management in Arts Organizations: Differentiating Arts and Culture Volunteers from Other Volunteers,"The goals of this research were twofold: to determine whether arts and culture volunteers can be differentiated from other volunteers based on variables from multiple conceptual domains; and to determine whether, in the domain of arts and culture, higher-performance volunteers can be differentiated from lower-performance volunteers. Lifestyle, demographic, personality, social influence and terminal-value measures were obtained from a sample of arts and culture volunteers and a comparison group of volunteers in other domains. The results suggest that arts and culture volunteers can be distinguished from other volunteers. The analysis also shows that several of the variables are useful in differentiating higher-performance arts and culture volunteers. Implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are presented.

,,,The Valuation of Ecosystem Services in South African Environmental Impact Assessments: Review of Selected Mining Case Studies and Implications for Policy,"Though the South African Mining and Biodiversity Guidelines were designed as a practical, user-friendly manual for integrating biodiversity considerations into the planning processes and managing biodiversity during the operational phases of a mine, from exploration through to closure, they do not specify exactly how ecosystem services can be assessed, in both non-monetary and monetary terms. The guidelines also do not indicate how the results of such assessments can be used in a meaningful way from the perspective of the mining sector and relevant stakeholders. This has led some mining houses and environmental impact assessment practitioners to explore ecosystem services valuation on a voluntary basis, going beyond legal requirements. Through the analysis of several case studies, this paper provides a critical analysis of how valuation of ecosystem services can be used to better inform mining project appraisal and management in South Africa. After discussing the main potential approaches to the valuation of ecosystem services within the mining life-cycle, we focus our attention on emerging valuation practices within the scope of environmental impact assessments and highlight the benefits and limitations of non-monetary and monetary valuation. We conclude by proposing the development of standardized guidelines and associated databases for assessing the net social and environmental impacts of mining in both non-monetary and monetary terms. Specific recommendations and research needs are also highlighted, towards producing information systems which would meaningfully link biophysical and economic data and enhance the decision-making capacity and leadership of mining companies, regulators and their stakeholders.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.60.58,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.60.58,Management & Organizational Behavior,2015.0,0,1.7931648471858352e-05,0,0.00027397857047617435,0,7.794480916345492e-05

Managers then must make choices about how their organizations will respond.

Compared to white men, white men and racioethnic minorities placed greater value on employer efforts to promote diversity, and held more favorable attitudes about the qualifications of women and racioethnic minorities. The study found that group rather than contextual organizational unit characteristics were more strongly related to diversity climate.

The greater the ratio of women in a unit, regardless of the respondents' gender, racioethnicity or level, the more favorable diversity activities were viewed.

,,,Sense-Making of Accounting Data As a Technique of Organizational Diagnosis,"Planning is a process of inquiry. Inquiry can be enhanced if different views-of-the-world are used to inform each other. In an exploratory field study, a sense-making exercise was used in the initial, goal definition stage of planning. Its use is antithetical because sense-making denies that management action is based on preconceived goals or objectives. Instead, sense-making assumes management action is a continuous, equivocal stream of experience that can only be understood (or made sense of) when it is viewed in retrospect. Accounting reports were prepared to describe a fictitious, but plausible future scenario for an organization. A number of alternative future directions that the organization could have followed-different kinds of organization it could have become-were used as a basis for creating the accounting reports.

,,,Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance: The Role of Process Conformance,"We examine the impact of employee turnover on operating performance in settings that require high levels of knowledge exploitation. Using 48 months of turnover data from U.S. stores of a major retail chain, we find that, on average, employee turnover is associated with decreased performance, as measured by profit margin and customer service. The effect of turnover on performance, however, is mitigated by the nature of management at the store level. The particular aspect of management on which we focus is process conformance-the extent to which managers aim to reduce variation in store operations in accordance with a set of prescribed standards for task performance. At high-process-conformance stores, managers use discipline in implementing standardized policies and procedures, whereas at low-process-conformance stores, managers tolerate deviations from these standards. We find that increasing turnover does not have a negative effect on store performance at high-process-conformance stores; at low-process-conformance stores, the negative effect of turnover is pronounced. Our results suggest that, in settings where performance depends on the repetition of known tasks, managers can reduce turnover's effect by imposing process discipline through standard operating procedures.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25146163,Organization Science,10.2307_25146163,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,0,1.022884407575475e-05,1,0.9655961394309998,1,0.6286388039588928

,,,The Free Cash Flow Hypothesis for Sales Growth and Firm Performance,"business is business! And business must grow -Dr. Seuss, The Lorax The paper investigates the agency argument that sales growth in firms with free cash flow (and without strong governance) is less profitable than sales growth for firms without free cash flow. It also tests whether strong governance conditions improve the performance of firms with free cash flow and/or limit the investments in unprofitable sales growth. Consistent with agency theory, firms with free cash flow gain less from sales growth than firms without free cash flow. But different governance conditions affect sales growth and performance in different ways. Having substantial management stock ownership mitigates the influence of free cash flow on performance, despite allowing higher sales growth. In contrast, outside blocks held by mutual funds reduce sales growth substantially, but does not increase performance from sales growth.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094238,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_3094238,Management & Organizational Behavior,2000.0,0,3.7720310501754284e-05,0,0.0002297793107572943,0,8.247230289271101e-05
,,,ISO 9000: Outside the Iron Cage,"Adopted by an increasing number of organizations around the world, the ISO 9000 standards have become a growing concern for more and more managers who are often compelled to adopt this system without really knowing its requirements and implications for employees. Though the effects of this standard on quality management and on performance improvement have been widely debated, there is little knowledge of how the managers and employees who are asked to implement and maintain it perceive the ISO 9000 standards or resist its use. This study will thus attempt to analyze this perception and resistance with regard to both the standard and the certification process. So as to avoid the traditional and idealised view of this standard, whose commercial stakes often give rise to uncritical statements, almost 50 interviews were conducted outside of the workplace. The results of these interviews revealed highly contrasting attitudes that were frequently critical of the ISO 9000 system, which was often given only superficial support. A qualitative analysis of the data allowed us to identify three types of respondents. They were grouped according to their opinions and attitudes about the implementation of this standard. The three groups were ceremonial integrators, quality enthusiasts and dissidents. Although the ""quality enthusiasts"" discourse often reflects managers' ""rhetoric of success"" described by Zbaracki (1998) about the implementation of total quality programs, this rhetoric is not shared by the other respondent categories. Hence, this research project contributes to a better understanding of how institutional pressures, which create ""isomorphic"" organizations by leading them to adopt identical management models, are reinterpreted, renegotiated, and modified within organizations. The proposed typology casts doubt on the mechanistic, consensual, and monolithic view of the ISO 9000 system that underlies most of the work on this theme. In particular, this study demonstrates the relevance of adopting both the institutionalist and critical approaches in efforts to explain the respondents' opinions. In so doing, the personnel's support for the ISO 9000 system and the certification process can then be analyzed from different angles. This certification process would ultimately appear to be a rite of passage that gives rise to various strategies that depend on the respondents' category and their support for the standard.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4135130,Organization Science,10.2307_4135130,Management & Organizational Behavior,2003.0,1,0.9999755620956421,0,0.0001683930604485795,0,0.0007165573770180345

It is demonstrated theoretically that incorporating positive skewness preference into the decision-maker's objective function typically produces a reduction in the demand for put options when compared with the mean-variance solution.

,,,Optimal Price Promotion in the Presence of Asymmetric Reference-Price Effects,"In this study we demonstrate how a reference price may affect the degree of price rigidity/flexibility. For this, we construct a model of reference-price formation, which we use to analyze the effect of asymmetric reference price (cut 'effects') on the profitability of price promotions. We derive explicit expressions for the additional profits earned during a promotional period due to consumer perception of a 'gain', and for the post-promotion loss of potential profits due to consumer perception of a 'loss'. We show that when effects of losses on demand are greater than effects of gains ('loss aversion'), price promotions always lead to a decline in profits. When, however, effects of gains are larger than those of losses, price promotions, as well as reverse price promotions (i.e. price increase) can be profitable. In the latter case we calculate the optimal depth and duration of a price promotion. We also show that reference price can affect price rigidity and flexibility.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25151542,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_25151542,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,0,6.763688361388631e-06,0,0.0002196645800722763,0,4.69364931632299e-05

,,,"Explaining the Swollen Middle: Why Most Transactions Are a Mix of ""Market"" and ""Hierarchy""","Why are firms sometimes more efficient than markets at organizing transactions? Why are most transactions arrayed neither at the pure ""market"" nor at the pure ""hierarchy"" end of the continuum, but rather in the ""swollen middle,"" incorporating features of both ""market"" and ""hierarchy""? Why don't firms make greater use of price incentives? This paper addresses these three questions by developing a model of the choice of institution. One key building block is the distinction between organizing methods (hierarchy and the price system) and institutions (firms and markets). Hierarchy and the price system are two distinct methods for organizing transactions, each with particular costs and benefits. Markets and firms are institutions which use one or both of these methods. Although markets predominantly use prices and firms rely principally on hierarchy, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between prices and markets or between hierarchy and firms. Indeed, the paper argues that it is generally more efficient to use a mix of both methods than to specialize in either. The paper focuses on the enforcement properties of prices and hierarchy. Hierarchy controls individuals directly by constraining their behavior (by imposing behavior constraints) while prices do it indirectly by measuring their outputs (through price constraints). Under hierarchy, individuals receive a salary to do as told, while self-employed individuals governed by the price system are rewarded on the basis of their output. Each system has its own biases: using prices maximizes effort (minimizes shirking) but incites individuals to inflate the price and/or reduce the quality of their output. (It encourages cheating.) Relying on hierarchy results in the opposite bias: under hierarchy individuals are not paid in function of their output, but instead are rewarded for following directives. They have, thus, strong incentives to minimize effort (to shirk) unless properly supervised, but, being paid a fixed sum to follow orders, they have few incentives to cheat. Hence the price system experiences low shirking, but potentially high cheating costs, while hierarchy faces low cheating but high shirking costs. Organizing costs are the sum of shirking and cheating costs. Any given transaction will be organized by the mix of price and hierarchy (i.e., by the mix of price and behavior constraints) that minimizes organizing costs. A transaction will be organized within a firm if the reduction in cheating costs achieved by replacing price constraints by behavior constraints exceeds the resulting increase in shirking costs and by the market in the opposite case. The paper shows that cheating and shirking costs increase more than proportionately as one concentrates in either pure price or behavior constraints. Hence using a mix of both methods generally minimizes the sum of cheating and shirking costs. This explains why most transactions exhibit features of both markets and hierarchy. The paper shows clearly the tradeoff involved between price and behavior constraints. It explains the costs and benefits of using two types of price incentives in firms, piecework and profit centers, and predicts when they will be used.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635079,Organization Science,10.2307_2635079,Management & Organizational Behavior,1993.0,0,6.269848381634802e-05,0,0.430774450302124,0,7.927550905151293e-05
