,,,Socioeconomic Achievement and the Machiavellian Personality,"To test the hypothesis that education moderates the relationship between interpersonal manipulativeness (""Machiavellianism"") and social atainment, data from a national sample (N = 1482) were reanalyzed. The resultss indicated that, for men with above-average educations, Machiavellianism is associated with higher levels of occupational prestige and larger incomes. However, for men with below-average educations, Machiavellianism is inversely related to occupational attainment, and unrelated to income attainment. Estimates of a structural equation model of the attainment process further support this interpretation, even after controls for race, age, social origins and education are applied. Extension of these analyses to status attainment among women revealed that Machiavellianism appears to have a facilitative effect upon women's attainment, but no evidence of an interaction effect was found. It is suggested that this pattern of results may reflect differences in the process of attainment in white-collar and blue-collar occupations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3033481,Sociometry,10.2307_3033481,Sociology,1977.0,0,0.001121114008128643,0,0.00014181631559040397,1,0.9973129630088806
,,,THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERNALIZATION AND SELF-ESTEEM AMONG BLACK ADULTS,"We address whether individual variation in internalization of positive or negative racial stereotypes was associated with low levels of self-esteem in a national probability sample of 2,107 self-identified black adults interviewed face-to-face in 1980 (National Survey of Black Americans). Rejection of positive stereotypes and acceptance of negative stereotypes were statistically linked to declining levels of self-esteem, controlling for background variables such as gender, region, education, age, income, marital status, and skin color. Weak evidence was found to suggest that the relationship between negative stereotype acceptance and self-esteem depended upon how close respondents felt to other blacks. We advocate that closer attention be given to conceptualizing internalization and measuring its psychological impact among stigmatized groups exposed to social discrimination.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20832150,Sociological Focus,10.2307_20832150,Sociology,2002.0,0,0.0002910052426159382,0,0.00014857982750982046,1,0.9981439113616943
,,,Changes in Women's Status in Women's Magazine Fiction: Differences by Social Class,"Women's magazines reflect and reinforce ideal characteristics of different social groups. Comparing the images of women in women's magazine fiction between 1970 and 1975 and between middle-class and working-class magazines, the former reflected economic and political movements in the relative status of women of that class. Middle-class women's fiction portrayed women as less likely to be valued for dependence and ineffectuality in 1975 as compared to 1970, and more likely to be valued for independence; plot devices were less likely to rely on traditional stereotypical female modes of behavior. In contrast, female passivity became more valued in working-class fiction. While in 1970, working-class women's fiction portrayed and valued the more active female characteristics, by 1975, that fiction had become significantly more traditional than middle-class fiction. This increase in valuing female passivity corresponds to the reversal of the long term secular trend from the 1950s onward of increased female labor force participation. Between 1970 and 1975 the labor force participation of women with less than high school education declined and job segregation by gender increased. Furthermore, the class selectivity in mobilization of symbols by the women's movement is evident.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/800041,Social Problems,10.2307_800041,Sociology,1979.0,0,0.010430369526147842,0,0.00016407479415647686,1,0.9023743271827698

I concluded from a two and one-half year ethnographic study of the post-9/11 experience of Arab Muslims in metropolitan Chicago that the underlying sociological conditions giving rise to these post-9/11 events were racialized and nativist understandings held by a significant proportion of southwest suburban whites that positioned Arab and Muslim Americans as cultural threats to their communities.

,,,The Role of Father's Occupation on Intergenerational Educational and Occupational Mobility: The Case of Second-Generation Chinese Americans in New York,"A considerable body of research has found a positive relationship between parents' socioeconomic Status and children's educational achievement and attainment. The predictive role of parents' socioeconomic Status generally applies for most racial and ethnic groups, but that association does not always hold for groups that exhibit high levels of education, such as Asian Americans. This article considers the role of parents' education and occupation on children's educational and occupational attainment for Chinese Americans aged 18-32. The results corroborate the positive link between parents' socioeconomic Status and children's educational and occupational attainments. Children of Professionals command an educational and occupational advantage over children of entrepreneurs and children of manual workers. Yet, the children of entrepreneurs attend selective Colleges and obtain Professional occupations in proportions closely following those of the children of Professionals. Although the educational attainments between the fathers who worked as entrepreneurs and those fathers engaged in manual work were comparable, it was the children of entrepreneurs who surpassed the children of manual workers with respect to educational and occupational achievement and attainment. This suggests that immigrant entrepreneurship contributes in the upward educational and occupational mobility of the children of entrepreneurs.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40210338,Sociological Forum,10.2307_40210338,Sociology,2009.0,0,1.774844895408023e-05,1,0.8281435370445251,1,0.9983764886856079

,,,Changes in the Segregation of Whites from Blacks During the 1980s: Small Steps Toward a More Integrated Society,"Residential segregation between blacks and whites persists in urban America. However, evidence from the 1990 Census suggests that peak segregation levels were reached in the past. We evaluate segregation patterns in 1990 and trends in segregation between 1980 and 1990 for the 232 U.S. metropolitan areas with substantial black populations. We review the historical forces that intensified segregation for much of the twentieth century, and identify key developments after 1960 that challenged institutionalized segregation. The results suggest that the modest declines in segregation observed during the 1970s continued through the 1980s. While segregation decreased in most metropolitan areas, the magnitude of these changes was uneven. Testing hypotheses developed from an ecological model, we find that the lowest segregation levels in 1990 and the largest percentage decreases in segregation scores between 1980 and 1990 occurred in young, southern and western metropolitan areas with significant recent housing construction. Because the black population continues to migrate to such areas, residential segregation between blacks and whites should decline further, but remain well above that for Hispanics or Asians.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2096131,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2096131,Sociology,1994.0,0,0.00034112471621483564,0,0.00020443732501007617,1,0.9994426369667053
,,,MARITAL STABILITY AND SOCIAL MOBILITY,"Studies of social mobility have produced ""dissociative"" and ""compensatory"" hypotheses about its effects on primary group relationships, and on the former hypothesis social mobility could be expected to be potentially disruptive of marriage, although in fact the relationship between mobility and marital stability has not been widely studied. Taking as starting point an article which denies the dissociative hypothesis in regard to marriage, this paper indicates that there are problems both of data and of definition in resolving this issue. The paper also suggests that there are reasons for supposing that social mobility can be disruptive of marriage, but that the matter cannot be settled by examining the overall statistical relationships of a few gross indicators. Rather than measuring net effects, enquiry should seek to discover patterns of effect and refined depiction of syndromes of marital instability.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23028525,International Journal of Sociology of the Family,10.2307_23028525,Sociology,1978.0,0,0.00022596785856876522,0,0.00019645033171400428,1,0.9749587178230286
,,,TRADE UNIONISM AND THE INSURANCE CLERK,"This paper attempts to demonstrate that changes in the class situation of insurance workers were important amongst the factors explaining the rapid increase in the density of TUC affiliated unionism amongst insurance clerks from the late 1960' s onwards. The clerical class position is situated in terms of Marxist categories, and related to the Weberian categories of'work' and 'market' situation. There then follows a brief history of insurance unionism. I then chart the economic difficulties of the insurance industry from the late 'fifties onwards; these were followed by the widespread rationalization of the insurance labour force—in particular, the introduction of the computer. I argue that the application of 'modern managerial techniques' and computer technology has transformed the nature of the insurance labour force—and thus the 'work' and 'market' situation of the insurance clerk. In conclusion, I briefly review other factors—e.g. government policy—which, together with the changes in class situation, have contributed to the growth in trade union membership amongst insurance workers.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42853377,Sociology,10.2307_42853377,Sociology,1979.0,0,0.003175213001668453,0,0.00016626264550723135,1,0.9524814486503601
,,,Nongenetic Familial Transmission of Psychiatric Disorders? Evidence from Children of Holocaust Survivors,"There is considerable evidence that psychiatric disorders aggregate in families, a phenomenon for which both genetic and nongenetic explanations have been proposed. However, since genetic and social inheritance usually co-occur, it is difficult to separate out their effects. In this paper, we argue that examining the rates of disorder among children of Holocaust survivors provides a special situation where genetic and nongenetic factors in familial transmission can be separated, and where specific nongenetic mechanisms can be tested. We specify competing hypotheses, and test their viability using data from an epidemiological study of psychiatric disorders conducted in Israel. We find no evidence of higher symptom scale scores or higher rates of current psychiatric disorders for the children of Holocaust survivors.

,,,Who Contacts Whom? Educational Homophily in Online Mate Selection,"Data from an online dating platform are used to study the importance of education for initiating and replying to online contacts. We analyse how these patterns are influenced by educational homophily and opportunity structures. Social exchange theory and mate search theory are used to explain online mate selection behaviour. Our results show that educational homophily is the dominant mechanism in online mate choice. Similarity in education significantly increases the rate of both sending and replying to initial contacts. After controlling for the opportunity structure on the platform, the preference for similar educated others is the most important factor, particularly among women. Our results also support the exchange theoretical idea that homophily increases with educational level. If dissimilarity contacting patterns are found, women are highly reluctant to contact partners with lower educational qualifications. Men, in contrast, do not have any problems to contact lower-qualified women. Studies of educational homogamy generally show that couples where women have a higher level of education are rare. Our study demonstrates that this is mainly the result of women's reluctance to contact lower qualified men.",external-fulltext-any,European Sociological Review,10.2307_41236583,Sociology,,0,4.7474259190494195e-05,1,0.9983137845993042,1,0.9388068318367004

The paper argues that while the latter is far from being conclusive and bound to continue for some time, actual restructuring of labour processes and industrial relations at local firms is going ahead – often under the banner of 'world class manufacturing'.

However, these analyses are typically zero-order (i.e., uncontrolled) and thus fail to address the possibility that partialling out the effects of potential explanatory variables might reduce such associations to insignificance. Using a three-generations sample of Mexican American Catholics, the authors regress subjective health onto religious attendance, alternatively controlling for four such variables: social support, physical capacity, social class, and subjective religiosity. Among both older and younger women, significant zero-order associations are explained away by removing the effects of physical capacity. These findings lend empirical support to theoretical work in social gerontology which suggests that religious attendance may represent a proxy for functional health, especially in older people.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386061,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1386061,Sociology,1986.0,0,2.024881359830033e-05,0,0.00011595980322454125,0,0.03120627999305725
,,,The Modern World as a Monolithic Iron Cage? Utilizing Max Weber to Define the Internal Dynamics of the American Political Culture Today,"If derived from the overall thrust of his sociological writings rather than his political essays, Weber's view of modernity is characterized by attention to the unique features of various advanced industrial societies rather than by a monolithic 'iron cage' vision. This study first demonstrates this point by briefly discussing central differences in the political cultures of Germany and the United States, and then by reconstructing, following Weber, the classic dualism in the American political culture: a 'world mastery' and self-reliant individualism stands opposed to–though also intertwined with–a public sphere penetrated by civic ideals. Although Weber's expectations regarding the fate of this classical dualism in the twentieth century can be seen today to be largely incorrect, the utilization of an axiom central to his comparative-historical sociology yields a powerful conceptualization of the present-day American political culture: pendulum movements across a 'tripolar constellation' are identified.

Such a label is, however, also problematic, as the social background or class profile of both parties shows an increasing deviation from 'conventional' bourgeois parties.

The concept involvement, as conceptualized for this theoretical mode, implies closely related, reacting interactions among reciprocal variables in relations to delinquent and criminal causality. Symbolic interactions require a commitment process, which facilitates self-motivation. However, Weigert firmly believes there is more to selfmotivation than objective commitments. The feeling aspects of motivation require, also, relative degrees of involvement. Highly involved individuals ""flow"" into social interaction with a powerful flood of compelling feeling. Hence, motivation is concerned with a person's cognitive commitments to or against social situations. Whereas, feeling aspects of motivation constitute the person's relative degrees of involved meaning, which subject actor acquires for or against social interactions.

,,,"Why Does Unemployment Come in Couples? An Analysis of (Un)Employment and (Non)Employment Homogamy Tables for Canada, the Netherlands and the United States in the 1980s","In this paper we first raise the factual question of whether wives of unemployed husbands have a higher chance of unemployment than wives of employed husbands. Data for Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and the USA in the first half of the 1980s indicate that this indeed is the case. We then seek to explain this finding. According to one explanation, (un)employment homogamy is a by-product of educational homogamy combined with a relation at the individual level between education and unemployment. Although the existence of educational homogamy in Canada, the Netherlands and the USA could be ascertained, and although in these countries unemployment is higher when education is lower, these findings could not fully explain the observed extent of (un)employment homogamy in these countries. According to a more complex explanation, the phenomenon of (un)employment homogamy will disappear when we allow, after these effects of education, for similar effects of age and region. This explanation was tested for the USA, and did not explain the observed extent of (un)employment homogamy in this country either. These findings show that labour market inequalities (unemployed persons have less education, are very young or very old, live in certain places) are aggravated by marriage market outcomes (educational and age homogamy).

This difference appears not only in substantial inequalities of access, but also in a higher level of expectation and value placed on the Internet among Indonesians and secondarily Malaysians. These results, from a survey and interviews of teachers and researchers in the social sciences and humanities, are analyzed in the context of dependency theory within knowledge economies. While inadequate and unequal access to information and communication technology is a substantial problem, the article argues that emphasizing access, resource and skills development alone will not solve academic and other more general dependencies within knowledge economies.

,,,The Power of Silence? Opinion Contagion and the Surprise of the Polish 2005 Parliamentary and Presidential Elections,"This paper investigates opinion contagion in collective behaviour using threshold model (Granovetter (1978)). The theoretical background is the spiral of silence concept developed by Noelle-Neumann (1974), arguing that people only assert their opinions if they perceive a minimal support from a relevant proportion of others. We apply the model to explain the dispersion between pre-elections preferences and the final results of the Polish parliamentary and presidential elections in 2005.

The results of an analysis of data from a sample of 686 insolvent savings and loan institutions support the hypothesis; stock-owned thrifts, those with a relatively low proportion of home mortgage loans, those with a high proportion of their assets in direct investments, and those that experienced high asset growth were the vehicles for the most costly and frequent incidents of suspected crime.

Building off theories of temporality and action, the authors map three different modes of future making—protentions, trajectories, and temporal landscapes—that actors need to coordinate in order to make sense of action together. Using a wide range of empirical evidence, they then show that these modes of future-coordination are autonomous from each other, so that although they are connected, they can clash or move in disjointed directions in interaction. By focusing on the coordination and disjunctures of those three modes, the authors argue that sociologists can provide a methodological axis of comparison between cases; depict mechanisms through which other theoretical or empirical constructs—such as racism or late modernity—operate; and open a window into the ways in which people organize and coordinate their futures, a topic of inquiry in its own right.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/668646,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_668646,Sociology,2013.0,0,0.000972145120613277,0,0.00015976515715010464,0,0.02471368946135044

,,,Indicators of Climate Change in Idaho:,"Climate change is well documented at the global scale, but local and regional changes are not as well understood. Finer, local- to regional-scale information is needed for creating specific, place-based planning and adaption efforts. Here the development of an indicator-focused climate change assessment in Idaho is described. This interdisciplinary framework couples end users’ data needs with observed, biophysical changes at local to regional scales. An online statewide survey of natural resource professionals was conducted to assess the perceived impacts from climate change and determine the biophysical data needed to measure those impacts. Changes to water resources and wildfire risk were the highest areas of concern among resource professionals. Guided by the survey results, 15 biophysical indicator datasets were summarized that included direct climate metrics (e.g., air temperature) and indicators only partially influenced by climate (e.g.,wildfire).Quantitative changes in indicators were determined using time series analysis from 1975 to 2010. Indicators displayed trends of varying likelihood over the analysis period, including increasing growing-season length, increasing annual temperature, increasing forest area burned, changing mountain bluebird and lilac phenology, increasing precipitation intensity, earlier center of timing of streamflow, and decreased 1 April snowpack; changes in volumetric streamflow, salmon migration dates, and stream temperature displayed the least likelihood.

This paper attempts to answer this question by focusing on a variety of advantages and benefits that an applied approach provides to those who teach in traditional classroom academic settings. The paper begins by drawing on a parable about teaching a teenager to drive and suggesting that learning to drive and learning sociology might have a lot more in common than we might imagine. The issue is placed in the context of current trends in sociology, especially ""the scholarship of teaching and learning"" and ""public sociology."" Four reasons for teaching applied sociology are presented: 1) It promotes more effective teaching and learning. 2) It is grounded in the roots of American sociology. 3) It helps produce change-based research; and 4) Students desire a sociology they can use to engage the world and to help improve it.

,,,Social and Political Transformation in the Czech Republic,"The most apparent recent social change in the Czech Republic is the emergence of a new class structure. A large percentage of the population began their private activities in small business, while a part of them managed to become middle-scale entrepreneurs. During the privatisation of the large companies, realised mostly by the voucher method, different groups competed to achieve positions in the top economic elite. Analyses of social mobility and of the factors of the income distribution have shown that the following groups have a higher chance of being successful in the ongoing social de-equalisation: the younger generations, better-educated people, managers and private entrepreneurs and those former Communists who left the party after the political changes in 1989. These social processes are being accompanied by a gradual change in the political elite. In this field, the most successful are the younger middle-aged, new political activists pushing through the radical liberal economic reform. In spite of the clearly right-wing character of the ruling coalition, a democratically acquired social consensus exists for the time being, although some signs of social and political polarisation are visible. In the near future, two main alternatives of development are possible: a) the continuation of the liberal democratic reforms (whether it be a conservative, centrist or left democratic variant or a compromise combination of them is of less importance) and b) a populist and authoritarian interruption of the transformation processes (be it a radical leftist or rightist variant). The realisation of the first alternative is not only desirable from the point of view of joining the European Union in the foreseeable future, but also more likely given both the objective and subjective conditions within the Czech Republic.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41133106,Czech Sociological Review,10.2307_41133106,Sociology,1994.0,0,1.8159997125621885e-05,0,0.00018132211698684841,1,0.9734237790107727

Two family-linked processes may lead to the social reproduction of a criminal class: a cultural/characterological process involving child-raising conditions and practices, and a structural/imputational process involving official labeling. Mead's concern about the perpetuation of a ""permanent class of criminals"" is discussed, and special attention is given to an intergenerational interaction effect of parent and son labeling on subsequent delinquent and criminal behavior. This intergenerational interaction effect is explored, net of the acknowledged role of cultural/characterological influences, which are modeled in several ways using data collected in a well-known London panel study.

Opportunities for increased female labor-force participation are likely to improve the feasibility of marriage, i.e., the ability of a newly married couple to meet social and economic expectations, while possibly reducing the desirability of marriage relative to the available alternatives. At the same time, the greater participation of women in economic life seems to increase both the feasibility and desirability of divorce.

,,,"COWBOYS AND SCHOOLTEACHERS: GENDER IN ROMANCE NOVELS, SECULAR AND CHRISTIAN","This article uses content analysis of 120 novels to consider romance novels as evidence for a particular culture of gender and the family, and as a means of comparing cultural representations of secular and Christian masculinity, femininity, and families. It finds that, although on the surface the texts are most obviously differentiated by religion, gender differences within the religious categories are greater than overall differences between those categories themselves. The most interesting and significant difference between secular and Christian romances emerges in the male hero. Specifically, this analysis finds that secular men are depicted as overwhelmingly strong, economically and physically, but that this strength is frequently overcome by the emotional strength of the heroine, who tames them.

,,,"Who Plays and Who Benefits: Gender, Interscholastic Athletics, and Academic Outcomes","Using a nationally representative sample of adolescents, this article examines how various individual and contextual characteristics are related to the likelihood of interscholastic athletic participation.

         of the country, and urbanicity have similar effects on socializing boys and girls into athletics. However, the gender difference in participation rates are greater for blacks than whites. Results indicate
         that some of the association between athletic participation and academic outcomes is due to the tendency for better students to participate in athletics. Net of these effects, analyses indicate that participation
         in athletics has a positive influence on adolescents' academic outcomes. The positive influence of athletic participation on unexcused absences and educational expectations is significantly stronger for

Its distrust of science, objectivity, and realism, on one side, and the embracement of the irrational, supernatural, and occult, on the other, are the signature of the new movement.

It is argued that structural functionalist theory and the information processing perspective, especially attribution theory, have exerted major influences on expectation states/status characteristics theory. This has resulted in unique conceptualizations of cognition, generalization, and status stereotypes colored by mechanistic and, in certain cases, rationalistic assumptions concerning the ways actors process information.

Viewing questions surrounding the issues of gender through an identity-oriented lens may shed light on some aspects of this complex topic. The present research utilizes social psychological and gender theories in order to better understand and explore the apparent contradictions in the gender discourse. Through the analysis of survey data on gender identity gathered from a university student population, we seek to illuminate the complex interactions that occur between self-meanings, perceptions, and behaviors related to gender identities. Specifically, we analyze: 1) how self-views of gender relate to perceptions of non-conforming gender displays, 2) how self-views relate to doing gender differently and 3) how these variables relate to perceptions of inclusiveness and safety.

With this definition of poverty, women were 'over-represented' amongst the poor in 1981, while in 1991 the situation is just the contrary, with indexes which show a smaller female share among the poor than the male share.

,,,"Parents' Discord and Divorce, Parent-Child Relationships and Subjective Well-Being in Early Adulthood: Is Feeling Close to Two Parents Always Better than Feeling Close to One?","We assessed the associations between parents' marital discord and divorce, patterns of parent-child relationships, and adult children's subjective well-being. Parental divorce and marital conflict appeared to increase the odds that children were close to neitherparent in adulthood. Parental divorce (but not marital conflict) appeared to increase the odds that children were close to one parent only. Drawing on parental resources and balance perspectives, we tested competing hypotheses about parent-child relationships and offspring subjective well-being. Offspring had the highest level of well-being when they grew up in a low-conflict married family and were close to both parents. In cases of divorce and high levels of marital conflict, however, children were no better off if they were close to both parents than to one parent only.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4494966,Social Forces,10.2307_4494966,Sociology,2007.0,0,2.5855099011096172e-05,0,0.00045857837540097535,0,0.3054063022136688
,,,Surviving the Transition: Trends and Perceptions of Crime in South Africa,"Crime and violence have dominated South Africa's transformation over the past two decades. High crime rates cause widespread feelings of insecurity and fear which undermine popular confidence in the democratisation process. Considering both trends and public perceptions, this paper explores changing crime levels over the past decade, elaborating on the problems associated with crime statistics in South Africa, and the salience of the transition for current crime levels. Data is drawn from official police statistics and from victimisation and other surveys. Crime has been increasing gradually in South Africa since 1980. It is, however, since 1990 and not more recently as is popularly believed, that levels have risen sharply. An examination of the statistics shows that despite general increases, not all crimes have been committed with equal frequency and not all areas of the country are similarly affected. These trends are a product of the political transition and are associated with the effects of apartheid and political violence, the breakdown in the criminal justice system and more recently, the growth in organised crime. High crime levels are taking their toll on South Africans. Surveys show that crime rather than socio-economic issues now dominates people's concerns, and that fear of crime is increasing. Currently, fewer people feel safe and believe the government has the situation under control than in previous years. Faced with widespread unemployment on the one hand, and the prospects of development on the other, levels of property crimes will probably continue to increase. While violent crime levels should decline over the medium term, improved relations with the police and a culture of reporting crimes like rape and assault may result in more crime being recorded.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27522260,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_27522260,Sociology,1997.0,0,0.00011299234029138461,0,0.00011912623449461535,0,0.2566596269607544
,,,Sociological Miniaturism: Seeing the Big Through the Small in Social Psychology,"The distinctive contribution of sociological social psychology can be referred to as sociological miniaturism, a way of interpreting social processes and institutions that is microsociological more than it is psychological. We argue that social psychology of this variety permits the examination of large-scale social issues by means of investigation of small-scale social situations. The power of this approach to social life is that it permits recognition of the dense texture of everyday life, permits sociologists to understand more fully a substantive domain, and permits interpretive control. In the chapter we provide examples of this approach from two quite distinct theoretical orientations: symbolic interactionism and social exchange theory. We discuss the ways in which the study of two substantive topics, social power and collective identity, using these perspectives can be informed by closer collaboration between theorists within sociological social psychology. In the end it is our hope that pursuing such integrative theoretical and methodological efforts will produce a more complete understanding of important social phenomena. We offer sociological miniaturism as a promising vehicle for advancing the earlier call for greater mutual appreciation of and rapprochement between diverse lines of social psychological work in sociology.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2678627,Annual Review of Sociology,10.2307_2678627,Sociology,2001.0,1,0.9213437438011169,0,0.0005634164554066956,0,0.00046292669139802456
