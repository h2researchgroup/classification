0,,,,Rotation of Expatriates in MNCs,"The article analyzes the recently highly criticized policy of rotation of expatriates in MNCs. It is based on an international comparative study of 51 MNCs and of diagnostic studies of 10 wholly-owned subsidiaries. The research clarifies that high officials at HQ are well aware of the advantages of rotation, but are not sufficiently familiar with the factors essential for its successful implementation, nor with the negative impact on the expatriates and the subsidiaries. Following the presentation of the different points of view of HQ officials, of expatriates and of senior host-country managers, the concluding part suggests several Steps whichmay increase the effectiveness of rotation and limit its inherent dysfunctions. /// Le présent article analyse la politique, récemment fort critiquée, de renouvellement des expatriés dans les sociétés multinationales.

1,,,,Does experience matter? The effect of founding team experience on the survival and sales of newly founded ventures,"While earlier researchers have argued that the founding team's industry and start-up experience should positively affect new venture performance, robust empirical support for these arguments has been lacking. Moreover, theory suggests that the relationship between founding team experience and new venture performance may be more complex than previous empirical research suggests. We test specific hypotheses about the effect of founding team industry and start-up experience on the survival and sales of 223 new ventures initiated by a representative sample of Swedish new ventures, using a methodology that overcomes the limitations to previous research. Our results show that founding team experience enhances both new venture survival and sales, but that the effects are non-linear, and vary with venture age.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23727583,Strategic Organization,10.2307_23727583,Management & Organizational Behavior,2006.0,0,1.2939377484144643e-05,0,0.00036737145273946226,1,0.9566771984100342

3,,,,The Long Tail: Myth or Reality?,"In 2004 the editor-in-chief of Wired magazine, Chris Anderson, made the assumption that the Internet was bringing together scattered markets for cultural products that had not hitherto been lucrative due to their narrow market appeal. With sales of these products aggregated, he argued, they were now becoming profitable. This assumption, referred to as the ""long tail,"" proved to be persuasive. It opened up prospective new markets for cultural goods, promoting the idea that online sales could increase cultural diversity. This article examines the initial research on the long tail assumption, drawing on the results of both published and unpublished works. It concludes that, despite the appeal of this argument, the data only partially support Anderson's assumption. En 2004, Chris Anderson, rédacteur en chef de la revue Wired, a émis l'hypothèse selon laquelle internet était en train de réunir des marchés dispersés pour des produits culturels qui jusqu'alors n'étaient pas lucratifs en raison de leur faible audience. Leurs ventes regroupées, ces produits devenaient rentables. Appelée « longue traîne » (long tail), cette hypothèse s'est avérée convaincante. Elle a ouvert de nouveaux marchés prometteurs pour les biens culturels, faisant valoir l'idée que les ventes en ligne pouvaient favoriser la diversité culturelle. L'article examine la recherche initiale sur l'hypothèse de la longue traîne en s'appuyant sur des travaux publiés et non publiés. Les auteurs concluent que, malgré l'attrait de l'argumentation, les données n'appuient que partiellement l'hypothèse d'Anderson. En 2004, el redactor en jefe de la revista Wired Magazine, Chris Anderson, supuso que la Internet estaba reuniendo mercados productos culturales dispersos que no habían sido lucrativos a causa de su limitada penetración al mercado. Argumentaba, sin embargo, que al estar reunidos empezaban a ser rentables. Esta suposición, conocida como la ”larga estela” parece haber sido persuasiva. Abrió nuevas perspectivas de mercado para bienes culturales, promoviendo la idea de que la venta en línea podría incrementar la diversidad cultural. Este artículo examina la investigación inicial sobre la hipótesis de la larga estela, basándose en los resultados publicados tanto como los que no lo han sido. Concluye qué, a pesar de lo atractivo que puede parecer este argumento, los datos recolectados solo sostienen parcialmente la hipótesis de Anderson.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41065027,International Journal of Arts Management,10.2307_41065027,Management & Organizational Behavior,2010.0,0,0.0008987842011265457,0,0.011769331991672516,0,0.0007348487270064652
4,,,,"SELF-DETERMINATION, ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS, AND QUASI-GOVERNMENTAL STATUS OF BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS IN THE UNITED STATES","Business improvement districts (BIDs) are special districts established by government with a nonprofit that sets policy and carries out services. Traditionally in BID literature, this arrangement is considered to be publicly authorized but privately initiated and managed. This paper argues that a more proper way of describing BIDs is that they are quasi-governmental entities, or organizations that have features of both government and private organizations. This structure lets them be more than public and more than private, one of the keys to their success. This theory that BIDs are quasi-governmental entities is supported by a survey that shows that BIDs are private entities that provide governmental services with substantial policy-setting independence from government. It also argues that quasi-governmental entities such as BIDs are created in situations where both the private market and government fail to adequately provide needed goods or services. This theory is backed up with interviews and research into why BIDs are created.",external-fulltext-any,Public Performance & Management Review,10.2307_40586800,Management & Organizational Behavior,,0,2.566053080954589e-05,0,0.00023411819711327553,0,9.061417949851602e-05
5,,,,The Transparency Paradox: A Role for Privacy in Organizational Learning and Operational Control,"Using data from embedded participant-observers and a field experiment at the second largest mobile phone factory in the world, located in China, I theorize and test the implications of transparent organizational design on workers' productivity and organizational performance. Drawing from theory and research on learning and control, I introduce the notion of a transparency paradox, whereby maintaining observability of workers may counterintuitively reduce their performance by inducing those being observed to conceal their activities through codes and other costly means; conversely, creating zones of privacy may, under certain conditions, increase performance. Empirical evidence from the field shows that even a modest increase in group-level privacy sustainably and significantly improves line performance, while qualitative evidence suggests that privacy is important in supporting productive deviance, localized experimentation, distraction avoidance, and continuous improvement. I discuss implications of these results for theory on learning and control and suggest directions for future research.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43548317,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_43548317,Management & Organizational Behavior,2012.0,0,0.0001797227159840986,0,0.1050160601735115,0,0.002541309455409646

The analysis suggests that this programme produces a number of conventional meanings within which specific messages about food are embedded. These findings indicate that television food programmes offer the hospitality provider important insights into the contemporary cultural formation of the consumer and into the ways by which key product concepts can be marketed, which can be of benefit to the hospitality industry. In addition, the categorisation of concepts and discourses upon which food programmes draw for their meanings offers a methodological and conceptual framework for future research of the genre.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42919209,International Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_42919209,Management & Organizational Behavior,1999.0,1,0.9563668370246887,0,0.00505705364048481,0,9.099447925109416e-05

11,,,,The Role of Media Critics in the Cultural Industries,"This paper explores the role of critics in the cultural industries through a multidisciplinary literature review. By synthesizing works in the fields of management, economics, sociology and information sciences, the author raises three issues. He begins with a short discussion of the nature of media criticism and its relationship to the cultural industries. He then tackles the question of how critical discourse is constructed: how do critics evaluate cultural products, knowing that both the economic fate of the work and the critic's professional legitimacy depend on the evaluation? Lastly, he considers the multiple roles played by critics. The author explores how this form of independent expertise plays a part in modelling the values and behaviours of different actors in the cultural field. He concludes the literature review by proposing several avenues for future research. L'article explore le rôle des critiques dans les industries culturelles par une analyse documentaire multidisciplinaire. En faisant la synthèse de travaux dans les domaines du management, de l'économie, de la sociologie et des sciences de l'information, l'auteur aborde trois sujets. Il commence par discuter brièvement de la nature de la critique dans les médias et de sa relation avec les industries culturelles. Il examine ensuite la manière dont le discours critique est construit : comment les critiques évaluent-ils les produits culturels, sachant qu'à la fois le sort économique de l'œuvre et leur légitimité professionnelle dépendent de l'évaluation? Enfin, il considère les multiples rôles joués par les critiques. L'auteur cherche à déterminer comment cette forme de savoir-faire indépendant joue un rôle dans le modelage des valeurs et des comportements de différents acteurs dans le domaine culturel. Il termine son analyse documentaire en proposant plusieurs voies pour la recherche future. Este artículo estudia el papel de la critica en las industrias culturales a través de un análisis de la literatura de diversas disciplinas. A partir de la síntesis de trabajos en los campos de la gestión, la economía, la sociología y las ciencias de la información, el autor plantea tres cuestiones. Comienza tratando brevemente la naturaleza de la crítica de medios y su relación con las industrias culturales. A continuación se aboca a la cuestión de la construcción del discurso crítico: ¿cómo evalúan los críticos el producto cultural, sabiendo que de esa evaluación depende tanto el destino económico del producto como la legitimidad profesional del mismo crítico? Para finalizar, el autor considera los diversos papeles que desempeñan los críticos. El autor del trabajo observa también de qué forma la participación de este conocimiento experto y externo contribuye a formar los valores y comportamientos de los distintos actores en el ámbito cultural.

12,,,,The Subsidized Contemporary Dance Market in France: Creation at All Costs,"The policy implemented by the French ministry of culture and by local authorities since the 1970s has enabled contemporary dance to form an artistic sector distinct from that of classical dance. A mixed economic system has been set up, with contemporary dance companies depending not only on subsidies but also on funding from theatres and festivals, which either purchase or coproduce performances. In spite of substantial increases in scheduling and attendance figures, the market for contemporary dance is characterized by a structural imbalance between the supply of productions and performances in the distribution network. Based on an empirical study of the dance world, the author shows how the strategies of various actors – dance companies, distributors, government bodies – converge to favour new productions over repeat performances of existing productions. This emphasis on innovation has led to persistent distribution problems. A marketing approach could bring a new vision to the dance world and a new relationship between artists and the public. À partir des années 1970, la politique menée par le ministère de la Culture et les collectivités locales permet à la danse contemporaine française de former un monde artistique distinct de celui de l'académisme. Un système d'économie mixte s'installe car les compagnies dépendent non seulement des subventions mais aussi des ressources apportées par les théâtres ou les festivals, qui achètent et parfois coproduisent les spectacles. Malgré un fort développement de la programmation et du public, le marché subventionné de la danse contemporaine se caractérise par un déséquilibre structurel entre l'offre de spectacles et les débouchés offerts par les réseaux de diffusion. Cet article, fondé sur une enquête empirique au sein du milieu chorégraphique, montre comment les stratégies des différents acteurs – compagnies chorégraphiques, diffuseurs, tutelles publiques – convergent pour privilégier les activités de création par rapport à l'exploitation prolongée des spectacles existants. Mais cette valorisation systématique de l'innovation provoque des difficultés chroniques de diffusion. Le marketing culturel pourrait apporter des solutions, à travers un changement de perspective et une meilleure compréhension de la demande finale. La política del ministerio de la Cultura y de las Colectividades Locales, impulsada a partir de los años setenta, permite a la danza contemporánea crearse un mundo artístico propio, distinto del mundo del academicismo. Se establece un sistema de economía mixta en el cual las compañías de danza dependen menos de subsidios, ya que acceden a otro tipo de recursos generados por los teatros y festivales, los cuales compran o coproducen espectáculos. Sin embargo, a pesar de un gran auge en materia de programación y público, el mercado subsidiado de la danza contemporánea se caracteriza por un desequilibrio estructural entre la oferta de espectáculos y las oportunidades brindadas por las redes de difusión. En este artículo basado en una encuesta empírica dentro del medio coreográfico, se muestra que las estrategias de los diversos actores – compañías coreográficas, difusores, tutelas públicas – coinciden en privilegiar más las actividades de creación que la explotación de espectáculos por tiempos prolongados. La importancia sistemática atribuida a la innovación crea dificultades crónicas de difusión. Mediante un cambio de óptica y una mejor comprensión de la demanda final, la mercadotecnia cultural podría brindar algunas soluciones.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24587060,International Journal of Arts Management,10.2307_24587060,Management & Organizational Behavior,2013.0,0,0.0160201545804739,0,0.00036847314913757145,0,0.0001390283869113773
13,,,,Spiritual Cleansing: A Case Study on how Spirituality Can Be Mis/used by a Company,"Organisational spirituality has gained popularity. While some authors see a spiritually fulfilling workplace as a benefit for employees and organisations alike, critical authors point out the potentially totalising effects of organisations that try to colonise employees' minds, hearts and souls. Whereas most existing critical studies are based on literature analyses and mainly refer to societal developments and how organisations are affected by them, the paper at hand provides a single case study on the organisational level. The case study allows a more detailed examination of how organisations can employ spirituality to serve organisational goals. The article identifies three aspects in which workplace spirituality can be misused: to mislead members about the nature of their work, about what an organisation can offer to its members and about the societal value of an organisation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41783637,Management Revue,10.2307_41783637,Management & Organizational Behavior,2010.0,0,0.042172014713287354,0,0.02417050115764141,0,0.00026634352980181575

15,,,,The Role of Instrumental and Expressive Social Ties in Employees' Perceptions of Organizational Justice,"We argue that employees' organizational justice perceptions are, in part, influenced by whom they associate with in the workplace. Consequently, we examine the link between different types of social ties and the interpersonal similarity of employees' perceptions of interactional, procedural, and distributive justice through a social network study in a division of a Fortune 500 firm. We predicted and found that social ties influence perceptions of justice to different extents, depending on the type of justice assessed. Expressive ties were associated with greater similarity in coworkers' perceptions than instrumental ties in the most affect-inducing justice perceptions, perceptions of interactional justice. Our findings suggest that the opinions held by an individual's coworkers influence others' justice perceptions, especially when justice is ambiguous and affect inducing, and that different justice perceptions may be transmitted via different types of social ties.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4135131,Organization Science,10.2307_4135131,Management & Organizational Behavior,2003.0,0,0.000153852000948973,0,0.0004611592448782176,0,0.00037861266173422337

A comprehensive review of federal, state, local, and utility plans, reports on drills and exercises, and the experiences of other states combines with field interviews and a survey of resources to describe the context for the TMI area. The paper proceeds to analyze the potential for further improvements in existing plans to effect a reduction in hazards posed to communities neighboring the TMI facility in particular and nuclear power in general. The overall analysis builds upon an earlier analysis of the problems attendant on the existing emergency-response system.

We propose that opportunity identification is a competency that can be developed as are other unique competencies and that the entrepreneurship classroom is an appropriate venue for developing the skills necessary to improve the ability to identify opportunities. Using a variation of a Solomon Four Group Designed experiment our results show that individuals can learn processes of opportunity identification and improve both the number of ideas generated and the innovativeness of those ideas.

19,,,,Niche and Performance: The Moderating Role of Network Embeddedness,"What is the relationship between niche and performance? We identify two types of niche positions--product niche and process niche--defined by the extent to which a firm offers distinctive products and has distinctive operational processes, respectively. We argue that the effect of each niche on firm performance is contingent upon network embeddedness--the extent to which a firm is involved in a network of interconnected inter-firm relationships. Using data covering the period 1995-98 pertaining to venture capital firms and their holdings in initial public offerings (IPOs), we show that both product niche and process niche interact with network embeddedness to determine firm performance. Our findings suggest that the extent to which a firm offers distinctive products or processes will be more positively associated with firm performance when network embeddedness is high.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20142219,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_20142219,Management & Organizational Behavior,2005.0,0,8.115897799143568e-06,0,0.0002389361907262355,1,0.5472753643989563

23,,,,A Model to Evaluate Variables Impacting the Productivity of Software Maintenance Projects,"The cost of maintaining application software has been rapidly escalating, and is currently estimated to comprise from 50-80${\tt\%}$ of corporate information systems department budgets. In this research we develop an estimable production frontier model of software maintenance, using a new methodology that allows the simultaneous estimation of both the production frontier and the effects of several productivity factors. Our model allows deviations on both sides of the estimated frontier to reflect the impact of both production inefficiencies and random effects such as measurement errors.

25,,,,A Transaction Cost Approach to Make-or-Buy Decisions,"This study focuses on make-or-buy decisions as a paradigmatic problem for analyzing transaction costs. Hypotheses developed from Williamson's efficient boundaries framework were tested in a multiple-indicator structural equation model. The influence of transaction costs on decisions to make or buy components was assessed indirectly through the effects of supplier market competition and two types of uncertainty, volume and technological. In addition to transaction costs, the decisions were hypothesized to be predicted by both buyer production experience and the comparative production costs between buyer and supplier. The hypotheses were tested on a sample of make-or-buy decisions made in a division of a U.S. automobile company. The results show that comparative production costs are the strongest predictor of make-or-buy decisions and that both volume uncertainty and supplier market competition have small but significant effects. The findings are explained in terms of the complexity of the components and the potential pattern of communication and influence among managers responsible for making the decisions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393030,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393030,Management & Organizational Behavior,1984.0,0,1.0003383977164049e-05,0,0.3946555554866791,0,2.3451670131180435e-05
26,,,,A Resource-Based Theory of the Firm: Knowledge versus Opportunism,"This paper develops a resource-based-knowledge-based-theory of the firm. Its thesis is that the organizational mode through which individuals cooperate affects the knowledge they apply to business activity. We focus on the polar cases of organization within a firm as compared to market contracting. There will be a difference in the knowledge that is brought to bear, and hence in joint productivity, under the two options. Thus, as compared to opportunism-based, transaction-cost theory, we advance a separate (yet complementary) answer to the question: why do firms exist? Our aim is to develop an empirically relevant and complementary theory of why firms are formed: a theory based on irreducible knowledge differences between individuals rather than the threat of purposeful cheating or withholding of information. We assume limited cognitive abilities on the part of individuals (bounded rationality), and assume that opportunistic behavior will not occur. The latter allows us to determine whether resource-based theory has independent force, as compared to the opportunism-based, transaction-cost approach. The paper predicts choice of organizational mode, identifying whether firm organization or market contracting will result in the more valuable knowledge being applied to business activity. The resource-based predictions of organizational mode are compared and contrasted with corresponding opportunism-based, transaction-cost ones. A principal point is that knowledge-based considerations can outweigh opportunism-related ones. The paper also establishes the relation of a theory of the firm to a theory of performance differences between competing firms.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635286,Organization Science,10.2307_2635286,Management & Organizational Behavior,1996.0,0,1.6730864444980398e-05,1,0.9997461438179016,0,9.791865886654705e-05

How extant literature acknowledges Buddhism informing sustainability as an alternative to current business practices predominantly governed by an economic rationale is examined. Thirty journal articles and 20 books/book chapters are analyzed. Commonly discussed Buddhist principles in the literature include the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Law of Karma, and Compassion. Through the analysis of Buddhist principles, a set of values are derived that enable the possibility of fostering sustainability in organizations. Core values emphasized are interconnectedness, moderation and empathy. Given the limited attention to date, this paper contributes to the extant literature through providing avenues for future research that could examine efforts to enact these core values in further exploring the connections between Buddhism, sustainability and organizational practices.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.61.44,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.61.44,Management & Organizational Behavior,2016.0,0,0.06649266928434372,1,0.9998900890350342,0,6.428128108382225e-05
31,,,,'Estimating tomorrow's tourist arrivals': forecasting the demand for China's tourism using the general-to-specific approach,"Accurate forecast of inbound tourism demand is vital for the tourism industry as well as government economic policy and decision making. This article sought to identify the factors which influence the demand for China's tourism with the aid of econometric models and to generate forecasts of international tourist arrivals to China from five major long-haul source markets. Using the general-to-specific modelling approach, the demand for tourism in China by the residents of Australia, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States of America is modelled and forecasted. The empirical results indicate that the 'word of mouth effect', income levels in the origin country, the costs of tourism in both China and competing destinations are the crucial factors that determine the demand for China's tourism by residents of the five origin countries. The forecasts show sluggish growth in tourist arrivals for most of the Western source markets.

32,,,,Environmental Quality Standards: A General Equilibrium Analysis," The increasing importance of pollution controls as a part of government regulatory activities has motivated considerable concern about the economic impact of these activities. This question is of considerable importance, because environmental quality goals are sometimes in conflict with other objectives such as full employment and economic growth. Policy-makers are thus faced with the task of identifying and measuring the trade-offs between these various objectives. But the measurement of these objectives requires information on their economic impacts. This paper develops a general equilibrium model with pollution specifications which can be used to identify the economic impacts of pollution-control policies. The particular pollution-control policy addressed is an environmental standards approach. The model is based on a technique that combines an explicit representation of consumer demand behaviour vis-à-vis linear aggregate demand functions with activity analysis.

33,,,,Venturing Abroad by Emerging Market Enterprises: A Test of Dual Strategic Intents,"This study presents a dual strategic intent perspective, elucidating that international venturing by emerging economy private firms is prompted by exploiting firm-specific advantages, as well as circumventing market imperfection residuals embedded in home country economic transformation. Our analysis of 1,355 Chinese private enterprises shows that their ownership-specific advantages in areas such as corporate governance, inherited advantage from mergers and acquisitions of state-owned companies, and inward internationalization increase the level of outward internationalization. Market imperfection residuals, such as industry structure uncertainty, also propel the inclination for internationalization. Two types of international experiences, one possessed by entrepreneurs and the other by private firms they lead, are positively associated with the proclivity for international venturing. Their moderating effect on the link between some ownership-specific advantages and venturing is negative, suggesting a substitutive role of experience in interacting with ownership-specific advantages with the process of internationalization.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23012287,MIR: Management International Review,10.2307_23012287,Management & Organizational Behavior,2011.0,0,4.967994027538225e-05,0,0.021419251337647438,0,7.732368248980492e-05

Using a national survey, firm visits and telephone interviews with US chemical firms, this analysis suggests that a reciprocal learning process between customers and suppliers occurs as firms exchange information to set and meet environmental requirements.

38,,,,Design and Analysis of Diagnostic Service Centers,"In the health-care domain, diagnostic service centers provide advice to patients over the phone about what the most appropriate course of action is based on their symptoms. Managers of such centers must strike a balance between accuracy of advice, callers' waiting time, and staffing costs by setting the appropriate capacity (staffing) and service depth. We model this problem as a multiple-server queueing system, with the servers performing a sequential testing process and the customers deciding whether or not to use the service, based on their expectation of accuracy and congestion. We find the dual concerns of accuracy and congestion lead to a counterintuitive impact of capacity: Increasing capacity might increase congestion. In addition, (i) patient population size is an important driver in management decisions, not only in staffing but also in accuracy of advice; (ii) increasing asymmetry in error costs may not increase asymmetry in the corresponding error rates; and (iii) the error costs for the two major stakeholders—the service manager and the patient—may impact the optimal staffing level in different ways.

This method was chosen due to the nature of the problem under investigation - employee injuries - and the failure of management to solve the problem with traditional methods. The action-research approach involved the establishment of an employee problem-solving group, interviews, the administration of a survey, the feedback of data, and experimentation in new work arrangements, as suggested by employee problem-solving groups. A nine-year review of the injury data both prior to and after the action-research intervention indicated that the intervention had the intended effect of reducing injuries.

43,,,,Dynamic and Risk Measurement Perspectives on Bowman's Risk-Return Paradox for Strategic Management: An Empirical Study,"Bowman's (1980, 1982) widely quoted papers have reported the existence of a risk-return paradox for strategic management. In this paper the authors examine the dynamic behavior of the risk-return relationship and analyze whether the risk-return paradox is stable across time. The analysis involves tracking Bowman's so-called negative association ratio across time. Using accounting measures of risk and return, it is demonstrated that while the paradox holds during the 1970s, the finding does not hold in the environment of the 1960s. Further, the paradox disappears if market-based risk measures are used. Some implications for strategic management are then discussed and attention is directed towards the meaning of risk in the context of strategic management. In addition, possible explanations for this paradox are evaluated and directions for further research are suggested.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486056,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_2486056,Management & Organizational Behavior,1986.0,0,1.5711004380136728e-05,0,0.0002726802777033299,0,0.00021653951262123883

45,,,,"Top Managerial Prestige, Power and Tender Offer Response: A Study of Elite Social Networks and Target Firm Cooperation during Takeovers","In this paper we explore the following research question: When faced with a tender offer, why do some firms resist and others cooperate? In the past, researchers have suggested that the manner in which firms respond to takeover attempts may be, in part, a function of managers' personal motivations. We contribute to this line of research by questioning whether other factors might be involved. Specifically, we examine whether cooperation may be a function of the friendliness of the bidding company and the social networks shared by executives in the two firms (i.e., bidder and target). We examine how the power and connections of managers affect their responses to tender offers. Our results suggest that these factors do indeed play a role. We found, for example, that target managers are more likely to cooperate under two conditions: (1) if they have less prestigious connections than managers in the bidding firm, and (2) if the target and bidding firms' share numerous ties to the same prestigious networks. In contrast, we found that target managers are more likely to resist a bidder's advances if: (1) the managers in both firms are poorly connected, or (2) the targets' managers hold more prestigious connections relative to the bidders. Together these findings suggest that cooperation and resistance may be a function of the social networks and power relationships that exist between and within firms. We discuss our findings within the framework of numerous organizational theories such as social class and social network theory, agency theory, and resource dependence. Although each of these perspectives suggests somewhat different results, we propose a reconciliation of these various perspectives. Specifically, we suggest that the variables of managerial power and connections may have different effects depending on whether we are observing firms before or after tender offers are made. It may be, for instance, that before a takeover offer is received, the power and prestige of target managers is associated with adoption of anti-takeover defenses (i.e., defenses designed to thwart takeover attempts). In fact, this finding has already been well documented in the literature. On the other hand, our findings suggest that after an offer is received, these same factors of prestige and power appear to be associated with resistance. Finally, our results call into question previous views that corporate takeovers are a mechanism for disciplining or ridding the company of incompetent managers. Instead, our findings suggest that the nature of the takeover process (i.e., cooperative versus resistant) may do little more than perpetuate existing social structures. Powerful and prestigious managers may not suffer the same negative effects of takeovers as their less prestigious and less powerful counterparts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2635197,Organization Science,10.2307_2635197,Management & Organizational Behavior,1993.0,0,3.003456185979303e-05,0,0.0004908204427920282,0,0.0011390427825972438
46,,,,Brownfield Acquisitions: A Reconceptualization and Extension,"Firms seeking specific complementary resources to pursue their growth strategy in emerging markets may use `brownfield' acquisitions to provide access to resources that are embedded in existing firms. This strategy requires a fundamental restructuring of the acquired firm to replace many of its resources and organizational structures. In this paper, we review the concept of brownfield acquisition, establish its empirical relevance outside of transition economies, explore its theoretical and empirical antecedents, and discuss its implications for theorizing in international business. Our empirical results based on a six-country survey in emerging markets show that brownfield acquisitions are most likely for projects that are more integrated with the parent's global operations, and where local firms are weak and institutions are strong. The concept provides a focal point for research on the resource-based view by illuminating the process of resource combination in firm growth. It also provides an example of where different aspects of the institutional framework may have contrary effects on various elements of business strategy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23012289,MIR: Management International Review,10.2307_23012289,Management & Organizational Behavior,2011.0,0,0.39701855182647705,0,0.004386212211102247,0,7.047201506793499e-05
47,,,,An Experimental Investigation of the Use of Computer-Based Graphics in Decision Making,"This paper presents the results of an experiment designed to investigate the impact of computer-based graphics on decision making. The experimental task consisted of selecting quarterly reorder quantities for an importer under condition of uncertain demand. Subjects in the experiment were participants in an executive program for middle and upper level managers. Each subject received information on the cumulative probability distribution of demand and had an opportunity to run up to eight trial simulations with past demand data using his or her order quantities. After completing the trial simulations, the subjects made quarterly ordering decisions for one year in which the quantities demanded were drawn from the demand distribution. Treatments included the use of a hard copy terminal and five different types of displays on a CRT. The results of the experiment provide limited support for the use of graphics presentation in an information system.
