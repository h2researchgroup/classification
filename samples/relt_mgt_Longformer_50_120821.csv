0,,,,Pricing an Option on Revenue from an Innovation: An Application to Movie Box Office Revenue,"We develop a model for valuing revenue streams from innovations. The stochastic properties of revenue from innovations create a more difficult environment in which to value options than when the underlying is a security. There is no initial revenue, and cumulative revenue cannot decrease. Revenues from innovations are characterized by different lives and different rates of the resolution of uncertainty. A common deterministic model for predicting revenue from an innovation is known as the Bass model. We embed the Bass model in a gamma process, resulting in a stochastic process with moments proportional to the mean of the Bass model. To illustrate this model we choose the valuation of options on movie box office revenue. These options enable film distributors to manage the risk of a movie, and they offer diversification opportunities for investors. We develop the econometric methodology for ex ante parameter estimation and a Bayesian updating scheme using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation as data after release become available. Call prices obtained using the maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimates from the full data set closely approximate the average discounted value of ex post call payouts that would have occurred at option maturity.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20122447,Management Science,10.2307_20122447,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,0,1.7352613213006407e-05,1,0.9996380805969238,0,4.3116513552377e-05
1,,,,Cultural rationalities in crisis sensemaking: a study of a public inquiry into a major industrial accident,"This paper investigates the sensemaking which occurred during a public inquiry into a fatal gas pipeline accident. The research conceives of the public inquiry as an important stage in crises, and investigates the role of multiple perspectives and rationalities in crisis sensemaking. Stakeholders at the inquiry are shown to differ in terms of their social organization, the cultural biases they hold, and the interpretations they make of events and risks. The paper extends the multiple perspectives approach to crises by linking this approach to theoretical developments in cultural analysis, and by showing the implications multiple perspectives have for inquiry and crisis stakeholders.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/26162686,Industrial Crisis Quarterly,10.2307_26162686,Management & Organizational Behavior,1990.0,1,0.9995291233062744,1,0.9571301341056824,0,8.134647214319557e-05
2,,,,"Even If the Tower Is ""Ivory,"" It Isn't ""White:"" Understanding the Consequences of Faculty Cynicism","Prompted by a seemingly growing level of cynicism within academia, on the part of Academy of Management members in particular, I developed a new measure of cynicism and investigated a previously untested structural model in which cynicism is related in sequence to organizational identification, affective commitment, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions. Data were obtained from 379 faculty members who were participants in the 2004 Academy of Management Meeting. Structural equation modeling was used to represent and test the hypothesized latent structure of the respective constructs, as well as the proposed structural paths between constructs. Support was found for the convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs underlying the structural model and for the network of proposed relationships. The implications of these findings for management education and learning, as well as avenues for future research, are discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40214514,Academy of Management Learning & Education,10.2307_40214514,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,0,0.2444971352815628,1,0.9998917579650879,0,0.001602407661266625
3,,,,Haves and Have-Nots: Investment Capital among Performing Arts Presenters in the United States,"Performing arts organizations are increasingly looking to build endowments as a means of stabilizing revenue flows. The authors report on a study of 272 arts-presenting organizations, some of which have built a substantial reserve while others have no savings at all. They hypothesize that the haves differ from the have-nots on seven factors: whether the organization is free-standing or part of a larger entity; the organization's age; budget size; whether the organization owns or rents its primary venue; the size of the board of directors; number of institutional donors; and proportion of revenues derived from donations. They conclude that the haves are larger organizations with large boards and a substantial number of institutional donors, factors that point to the value of budget size, network contacts and institutional legitimacy in the accumulation of investment capital. Les organismes d'arts de la scène sont de plus en plus nombreux à vouloir se constituer un fonds pour investissements afin de stabiliser les mouvements de leurs revenus. Les auteurs présentent les résultats d'un sondage effectué auprès de 272 organismes présentateurs de spectacles artistiques, dont certains ont accumulé une importante réserve quand d'autres n'en ont aucune. Ils avancent l'hypothèse que sept facteurs distinguent les premiers des seconds : l'autonomie de l'organisme ou son inclusion dans une entité plus vaste; l'âge de l'organisme; l'importance de son budget; la propriété ou la location de son lieu de présentation principal; la taille du conseil d'administration; le nombre de donateurs institutionnels; et la part des revenus provenant de dons. Les auteurs en concluent que les nantis sont de grands organismes dirigés par d'imposants conseils d'administration et bénéficiant de l'appui de nombreux donateurs institutionnels, facteurs qui soulignent l'importance d'un budget de taille, du réseau de connaissances et de la légitimité de l'organisme pour l'accumulation de capitaux de placement. Las organizadones dedicadas a las artes escénicas están volcándose cada vez más a la obtendón de legados como medio de estabilizar sus flujos de caja. En este artículo se presentan las conclusiones de un estudio realizado entre 272 entidades que presentan espectáculos artísticos, de las cuales hay algunas que han acumulado reservas importantes en tanto que otras no cuentan con ahorro alguno. Los autores trabajan sobre la hipótesis de que las organizadones ""pudientes"" se diferendan de las ""carendadas"" en siete aspectos: en que sean propietarias o inquilinas de su sala príndpal; en el tamaño de su consejo de administradón; en la cantidad de donantes institudonales; y en la propordón de ingresos que provienen de donadones. La conclusión que se deriva de este estudio es que las organizadones pudientes son de mayor envergadura, con un numeroso consejo de administradón y gran cantidad de donantes institudonales, factores estos que subrayan el valor de un presupuesto amplio, una red de contactos y legitimidad institudonal en el proceso de acumuladón de capital de inversión.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41064820,International Journal of Arts Management,10.2307_41064820,Management & Organizational Behavior,2004.0,0,9.481675806455314e-05,1,0.8076766729354858,0,0.011966712772846222

6,,,,Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance: The Role of Process Conformance,"We examine the impact of employee turnover on operating performance in settings that require high levels of knowledge exploitation. Using 48 months of turnover data from U.S. stores of a major retail chain, we find that, on average, employee turnover is associated with decreased performance, as measured by profit margin and customer service. The effect of turnover on performance, however, is mitigated by the nature of management at the store level. The particular aspect of management on which we focus is process conformance-the extent to which managers aim to reduce variation in store operations in accordance with a set of prescribed standards for task performance. At high-process-conformance stores, managers use discipline in implementing standardized policies and procedures, whereas at low-process-conformance stores, managers tolerate deviations from these standards. We find that increasing turnover does not have a negative effect on store performance at high-process-conformance stores; at low-process-conformance stores, the negative effect of turnover is pronounced. Our results suggest that, in settings where performance depends on the repetition of known tasks, managers can reduce turnover's effect by imposing process discipline through standard operating procedures.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25146163,Organization Science,10.2307_25146163,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,0,1.022884407575475e-05,1,0.9655961394309998,1,0.6286388039588928

9,,,,Considering the gap between Implicit Leadership Theories and expectations of actual leader behaviour: A three-study investigation of leadership beliefs in Romania,"The conceptual base of behavioural preferences for leadership can be found in Implicit Leadership Theories (ILTs). In a series of three studies, we examined both ILTs and expectations for leader behaviour for the purpose of examining the degree of fit between ILTs and associated expectations. In our first study we found that ILTs for transformational and transactional leadership are highly related, although participant's ILTs were either not related or weakly related to expectations of actual leader behaviour. We conducted two follow-up studies to examine the understanding of transformational and transactional leadership in Romania. We discuss the findings in terms of how culturally-derived factors may serve to influence ILTs and profiles of expected leader behaviours. Implizite Führungstheorien (ILTs) bilden die konzeptionelle Basis für Führungsverhaltenspräferenzen. In drei Studien haben wir jeweils ILTs und die Führungsverhaltenserwartungen im Hinblick auf ihre Übereinstimmung hin untersucht. In der ersten Studie haben wir festgestellt, dass ILTs sich stark auf transformative und transaktionale Führung beziehen, obwohl die ILTs der Teilnehmer entweder keine oder nur eine schwache Relation auf die Erwartungen des eigentlichen Führungsverhaltens hatten. Wir haben zwei Folgestudien durchgeführt, um das Verständnis für transformative und transaktionale Führung in Rumänien zu untersuchen.

It points out that most economies already exist in partial isolation, often self-imposed. The most serious consequence of sanctions will be the granting to the government of a moral licence to react repressively, thus shutting off existing political and economic `safety valves'. The net result will be even more stringent political repression, and further resistance to change. The government will find it hard to retreat from this situation, and relax the repression. The result is a society without the flexibility to change.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2560519,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_2560519,Management & Organizational Behavior,1987.0,0,6.890573786222376e-06,1,0.9829419255256653,0,0.0016301163705065846

13,,,,Forward Linkages and Follow-up Investment Abroad: An Input-Output-Analytical Approach,"Empirical evidence regarding the phenomenon of firms deciding to invest abroad because their customers do so (""follow-up pattern""), is scarce. Up to now, only a few motive analyses have been pursued. They suggest that the follow-up pattern plays a certain, though minor role in explaining foreign direct investment. In this paper it was attempted to reevaluate the role of the follow-up pattern by using an empirical approach in which the linkage structure in I--O tables is interpreted as an indication of the need to follow-up. That is, West German data has been employed in order to estimate the extent to which the foreign investment position of a branch of industry tentatively might be explained by (a) the relative importance of the respective branch's forward linkages to industrial customers and (b) these customers' foreign investment position. On the whole, the regression results tend to confirm what could be expected in the light of the aforementioned earlier studies. The actual extent to which foreign investment determines the investment pattern, of course could not be estimated in the framework of this study.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40227577,Management International Review,10.2307_40227577,Management & Organizational Behavior,1981.0,0,2.015218706219457e-05,1,0.9999749660491943,0,0.0008310370030812919
14,,,,The danger of misinterpreting short-window events study findings in strategic management research: an empirical illustration using horizontal acquisitions,"Short-window event studies are popular in the strategic management literature. These studies assume that the market's initial reaction to strategic events reflects their economic impact in an unbiased manner. This assumption may hold in some cases, but when an event has complex ramifications that are difficult to predict, the initial market response may be biased and/or incomplete. Acquisitions are complex events, suggesting that results from short-window event studies of acquisitions may foster incorrect inferences. Using a sample of horizontal acquisitions, this article shows that the positive initial market response to an acquisition announcement is contradicted by negative long-run post-acquisition returns, suggesting that the initial response is incorrect and that the error is rectified later. Our findings imply that short-window event studies may not accurately capture the economic impact of complex strategic actions, for the interpretation and use of event studies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23728643,Strategic Organization,10.2307_23728643,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,0,1.7324273358099163e-05,1,0.9079824090003967,0,0.00448734313249588

16,,,,What Role for Marketing in the Arts? An Analysis of Arts Consumption and Artistic Value,"This article examines the role of marketing in the arts. Reflecting on the issue requires an understanding of both the meaning of artistic value and its diffusion process. Artistic value can be seen as a ""flow potential"" embedded in a product that may or may not be recognized by those who encounter it. When artistic potential is recognized, it is diffused on a social level and marketing is drawn in. The diffusion process can be broken down into different stages that link the artist to the wider public. Along this path, artistic value is transformed from an ""emergent"" state to an ""emerged"" one, and also acquires social and economic value. Marketing attends to the services managed by the subjects who transfer the artistic value from the artist to the public in order to increase the emergent artistic potential or to enhance the emerged one. Different services and marketing tools are used at each stage of the diffusion process. L'article porte sur le rôle du marketing dans le domaine des arts. Selon l'auteure, toute réflexion sur le sujet exige une compréhension préalable de la valeur artistique et de son processus de diffusion. La valeur artistique peut être considérée comme un potentiel intrinsèque au produit, reconnu ou non par ceux qui l'approchent. Une fois identifié, le potentiel artistique doit être diffusé; le marketing entre alors en jeu. Le processus de diffusion peut être décomposé en différentes étapes au cours desquelles un lien s'établit entre l'artiste et le public. La valeur artistique se transforme : d'émergente, elle devient apparente et le produit acquiert une valeur sociale et économique. Le marketing correspond aux services fournis par ceux qui transfèrent la valeur artistique de l'artiste au public pour accroître le potentiel artistique émergent ou pour rehausser la valeur apparente. Des services et des outils marketing différents sont utilisés à chaque étape du processus de diffusion. En este artículo se analiza el papel del marketing en las artes. Para reflexionar sobre este tema se necesita comprender el significado del valor artístico y de su proceso de difusión. Se puede ver el valor artístico como un ""potendal de flujo"" incorporado a un producto, el que puede o no ser reconocido como tal. Una vez el potendal artístico reconocido, se le difunde en el ámbito sodal y el marketing entra en juego. El proceso de difusión puede desglosarse en diferentes etapas que vinculan al artista con un público más amplio. Durante este proceso el valor artístico pasa de un estado ""emergente"" a un estado ""pleno"", y también adquiere valor sodal y económico. El marketing es una herramienta que utilizan los encargados de transfenr el valor artístico del artista al público ya sea para incrementar el potendal artístico emergente o para aumentar el valor ya ""surgido"". Se emplean diferentes servidos y herramientas de marketing en cada etapa del proceso de difusión.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41064697,International Journal of Arts Management,10.2307_41064697,Management & Organizational Behavior,2000.0,0,3.152685530949384e-05,0,0.0017803021473810077,0,0.00021136639406904578

18,,,,Strategic Aggressiveness: The Effects of Gain-Thrust Schema and Core Stakeholder Salience,"Growing research has emphasized the antecedents and consequences of competitive actions. Authors in this research stream have generally combined strategic and tactical actions in defining competitive actions. Prior work has also built from prospect theory which was developed for individual behavior and may not be well adapted to complex organizational situations. This research addresses these gaps in prior work first by focusing exclusively on strategic actions. Strategic actions as a standalone variable are important because they involve substantial resource commitments, which are irreversible. Second, rather than use a foundation of prospect theory, this study argues that senior managers adopt a ""gain-thrust schema"" in today's highly competitive and dynamic business landscape. This schema calls for aggressive strategic actions to gain and sustain competitive advantages. The aggressive strategic actions, in turn, may become susceptible to the forces of momentum, which may lead to exorbitant aggressiveness with negative performance consequences. Contrary to the prediction by the prospect theory, good past performance is a catalyst for aggressive strategic actions. These arguments are articulated in the backdrop of a theoretical framework and tested via four hypotheses. The results are, for the most part, in the predicted direction.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23209118,Journal of Managerial Issues,10.2307_23209118,Management & Organizational Behavior,2011.0,0,8.764347512624227e-06,0,0.0024177557788789272,0,0.0023793333675712347

Although this notion has been an important factor in estimating experience curves and in formulating corporate strategies, we show that it is generally inconsistent with published multiperiod optimal pricing models. The paper then goes on to demonstrate that this apparent conflict can be reconciled by allowing the demand process to exhibit increasing price elasticity over time. Since this demand characteristic is very plausible for innovative products, we suggest it be incorporated into optimal pricing models.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2487551,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_2487551,Management & Organizational Behavior,1986.0,0,8.980370694189332e-06,0,0.00025756252580322325,0,0.00012429917114786804

ShoreBank Corporation, a recognised leader in expanding access to finance in the USA, was a commercial bank focused on revitalising communities on the south side of Chicago and demonstrating the business potential for community banking. United by common roots and similar goals, BRAC and ShoreBank began what would become a deep and long-term partnership in the 1980s. This unusual case study draws on unique, longitudinal field research, gathered first hand and meticulously archived by a senior leader of one of the organisations. It examines the details of the unique and long-lasting relationship between BRAC and ShoreBank, how the partnership was initially formed, the conditions which allowed it to flourish, the innovations made possible by this partnership, and the impact of their collaborative approach on the field of access to finance. The paper concludes that the partnership, and the way it was formed and managed, has allowed for a ‘platform for innovation’ including lending in countries and regions considered off limits, providing finance to small businesses, and providing mobile banking services to rural and unbanked customers.

However, we are not aware of any study that links top management decisions with project members' collaborative behavior. To address this significant gap, this study examines how perceived procedural justice in top management decisions regarding new products is related to collaborative problem solving among new product development project members. Our results from 109 technology firms-as well as from 91 student-based project groups-suggest that perceived procedural justice in top management decisions is positively related to collaborative problem solving among project members, and that collaborative problem solving mediates the relationship between perceived procedural justice and new product performance. Furthermore, we found that the relationship between perceived procedural justice and collaborative problem solving is positively moderated by environmental uncertainty.

25,,,,On the Value of Free Foreign-Exchange Forecasts,"The objective of this paper is to assess the value of free foreign-exchange forecasts. Taking the exchange-rate projections published by Lloyds Bank as an example, it is shown that there is no reason to assume that these projections consistently outperform the most easily available benchmark, the current spot exchange rate. Moreover, the returns to speculative investment based on these projections seem to be, at best, insignificant. The value of such forecasts must, therefore, be regarded as negligible.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2487061,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_2487061,Management & Organizational Behavior,1987.0,0,6.372979896696052e-06,1,0.9968249797821045,0,5.5619198974454775e-05
26,,,,Strategies of Engagement: Lessons from the Critical Examination of Collaboration and Conflict in an Interorganizational Domain,"Many writers advocate interorganizational collaboration as a solution to a range of organizational and intersectoral problems. Accordingly, they often concentrate on its functional aspects. We argue that collaboration deserves a more critical examination, particularly when the interests of stakeholders conflict and the balance of power between them is unequal. Using examples from a study of the UK refugee system, we argue that collaboration is only one of several possible strategies of engagement used by organizations as they try to manage the interorganizational domain in which they operate. In this paper, we discuss four such strategies: collaboration, compliance, contention and contestation. By examining the stakeholders in the domain and asking who has formal authority, who controls key resources, and who is able to discursively manage legitimacy, researchers are in a stronger position to evaluate both the benefits and costs of these strategies and to differentiate more clearly between strategies that are truly collaborative and strategies that are not. In other words, we hope to demonstrate that collaboration between organizations is not necessarily ""good"", conflict is not necessarily ""bad"", and surface dynamics are not necessarily an accurate representation of what is going on beneath.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640354,Organization Science,10.2307_2640354,Management & Organizational Behavior,1998.0,0,3.8783924537710845e-05,1,0.9993889331817627,0,6.396019307430834e-05
27,,,,Negotiations after the Sale: The Roots and Ramifications of Conflict in an Acquisition,"This paper presents a case study of negotiations over the combination of a small manufacturing firm into a multi-billion dollar conglomerate following its `white knight' acquisition. It focuses on the strategic and tactical conflicts between the two firms and traces these to the party's emotional reactions to the combination. Feeling of loss versus gain in the two firms, each party's sense of uncertainty and threat, and their moves toward proactive versus reactive control in the combination are analysed to identify the roots of strategic conflict. These feelings, plus incompatibilities in the two company's managements, business systems, corporate cultures, and goals for combination ramify in conflict in the negotiations themselves. The paper concludes with a more generic model illustrating contextual features of combinations that shape human reactions and conflicts in negotiations after the sale.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3000350,Journal of Occupational Behaviour,10.2307_3000350,Management & Organizational Behavior,1985.0,0,3.960133471991867e-05,1,0.9992274045944214,0,0.0006516164867207408
28,,,,Knowledge Mobility in Cross-Border Buyer-Supplier Relationships,"This paper contributes to the debate on the influence of knowledge sourcing in emerging markets by multinational enterprises. The study builds on transaction cost theory, organizational learning theory and the knowledge-based view to examine the determinants and consequences of knowledge mobility in cross-border buyer-supplier relationships. I hypothesize that protection and knowledge attributes influence knowledge acquisition from international strategic alliances and that knowledge mobility enhances local suppliers' innovation capabilities. Using survey data of 160 firms in the information technology (IT) sector and a structural equation methodology, the empirical results indicate the positive impact that knowledge attributes have on protection. Furthermore, knowledge mobility in cross-border relationships positively affects the development of firms' innovation capabilities. The implications are discussed at the end of the paper.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41494971,MIR: Management International Review,10.2307_41494971,Management & Organizational Behavior,2012.0,0,2.6328651074436493e-05,1,0.9606154561042786,0,5.302413410390727e-05
29,,,,Strategy Formation and Corporate Citizenship: Conversations and Decisions that Matter,"A major deficiency of traditional strategy-making is that most minds within the organisation are not brought into the process. As corporate citizenship becomes imperative, a variety of internal and external stakeholders will seek more involvement in deliberations on business strategy and policy. In this respect, this paper provides a corporate citizenship framework for understanding and designing processes for generating and implementing strategic change. Several generic principles of strategy formation that draws on corporate citizenship are defined: inclusiveness, ethic of reciprocity, psychological safety, ideation and simple rules. These dimensions are illustrated by way of two approaches that have been extensively tested in a variety of organisations: appreciative inquiry and circular organising. We summarise and compare these approaches. As such, a key design parameter appears to be whether the main interest is in ‘conversations that matter’ or ‘decisions that matter’.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.38.93,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.38.93,Management & Organizational Behavior,2010.0,0,0.00042790567385964096,1,0.9999599456787109,0,4.0015424019657075e-05

Our results confirmed previous findings suggesting that although business segment effects carry the most relative importance, industry and corporate effects are also important.

32,,,,Reexamining The Relationship Between Action Preferences And Managerial Risk Behaviors,"Building on prospect theory and behavioral theories, and taking insights from theories of social cognition, we build a model of managerial risk behaviors. The antecedents are organizational resources, performance indicators, and problem framing. Based on social cognition concepts, we develop a construct called ""action preferences,"" which explains adaptive versus non-adaptive behaviors. The impact of negativity effect results in adaptive behaviors like escape, avoidance, and other ways to overcome threatening events. Action preferences provide a more compelling and complete explanation of managerial risk behaviors. Action preferences partially mediate the relationship between the exogenous signals and managerial risk behaviors. The proposed model examines the indirect effects of the exogenous variables on managerial risk behaviors. We predict that the mediating role of action preferences will maximize the explained variance of managerial risk behaviors. We argue that a model of managerial risk action that includes action preferences as a mediator will provide a better explanation of the processes underlying managerial risk behaviors. Several propositions, including interactions, that examine the relationship between the exogenous variables and action preferences, and between action preferences and managerial risk behaviors, are also suggested.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40604393,Journal of Managerial Issues,10.2307_40604393,Management & Organizational Behavior,2002.0,0,1.6883292119018734e-05,1,0.9857096672058105,0,9.839452104642987e-05
33,,,,A Closer Look at the Decision to Accept an Overseas Position,"A sample of 135 expatriate American upper middle managers were asked to make ratings regarding the importance on certain variables they considered when they decided to accept their current overseas assignment. A factor analysis identified different dimensions underlying the decision spaces between experienced and inexperienced expatriate managers. In the inexperienced expatriate, the overseas assignment represents a necessary steppingstone for advancement in the parent company hierarchy. The experienced expatriate manager chooses an additional assignment for related but not the same motives as the inexperienced expatriate. In the experienced expatriate, they have made a career choice to remain in international business. /// Il fut demandé à cent trente-cinq cadres subalternes américains d'indiquer leur appréciation des motifs quiles ont amenés à accepter un poste à l'étranger. Une analyse factorielle avait été effectuée pour définir l'espace décisionnel des cadres expérimentés et des cadres non expérimentés. Il apparaît que pour ces derniers l'acceptation d'un poste à l'étranger était considéréé comme une étape nécessaire pour monter l'échelle hiérarchique de leur société. Quant aux cadres expérimentés, ils ont accepté, il est vrai, de telles positions pour des motifs analogues, mais aussi pour pouvoir faire une carrière dans le commerce international. /// Im Rahmen einer Stichprobenuntersuchung wurden 135 ausgewanderte amerikanische Manager der oberen Mittelklasse gebeten, die Bedeutung bestimmter Variablen, die sie bei ihrer Entscheidung, die gegenwärtige überseeische Position anzunehmen, berücksichtigt haben, zu beurteilen.

35,,,,The Silver Lining Effect: Formal Analysis and Experiments,"The silver lining effect predicts that segregating a small gain from a larger loss results in greater psychological value than does integrating them into a smaller loss. Using a generic prospect theory value function, we formalize this effect and derive conditions under which it should occur. We show analytically that if the gain is smaller than a certain threshold, segregation is optimal. This threshold increases with the size of the loss and decreases with the degree of loss aversion of the decision maker. Our formal analysis results in a set of predictions suggesting that the silver lining effect is more likely to occur when (i) the gain is smaller (for a given loss), (ii) the loss is larger (for a given gain), and (iii) the decision maker is less loss averse. We test and confirm these predictions in two studies of preferences, both in a nonmonetary and a monetary setting, analyzing the data in a hierarchical Bayesian framework.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40539246,Management Science,10.2307_40539246,Management & Organizational Behavior,2009.0,0,9.591272828401998e-06,1,0.9992895126342773,0,0.0001861993077909574
36,,,,Alternative Models Of Collegiate Business Education: Their Validity And Implications,"With the development of new mission-driven AACSB accreditation standards, Earl Cheit's academic and professional models of business education have assumed increasing significance. Despite the intuitiveness of these models, they have not been externally validated and such is required to enhance theorizing about them. This work seeks to validate the two models. The validation involved having deans self-assess the location of their business school along the two dimensions/models of business education. Based on these locations, deans were classified using a criteria set that resulted in two groupings (one academic, the other professional). These groups were related to deans' responses to belief and value variables that were derived from academic and professional model issues. The results matched hypothesized expectations, thus supporting the models' existence. The implications of the two models are advanced.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40604113,Journal of Managerial Issues,10.2307_40604113,Management & Organizational Behavior,1996.0,0,2.818855682562571e-05,1,0.9998973608016968,0,0.0005184714682400227
37,,,,Combining Probability Distributions from Dependent Information Sources,"Inferences or decisions in the face of uncertainty should be based on all available information. Thus, when probability distributions for an uncertain quantity are obtained from experts, models, or other information sources, these distributions should be combined to form a single consensus distribution upon which inferences and decisions can be based. An important feature of information from different sources is the possibility of stochastic dependence, and a consensus model which formally allows for such dependence is developed in this paper. Under normality, the model yields reasonably tractable results, and the consensus distribution is quite sensitive to the degree of dependence.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631338,Management Science,10.2307_2631338,Management & Organizational Behavior,1981.0,0,2.4598029995104298e-05,1,0.9556176662445068,0,0.00033095222897827625
38,,,,Association between Supply Chain Glitches and Operating Performance,"This paper empirically documents the association between supply chain glitches and operating performance. The results are based on a sample of 885 glitches announced by publicly traded firms. Changes in various operating performance metrics for the sample firms are compared against a sample of control firms of similar size and from similar industries. In the year leading up to the announcement, the control-adjusted mean percent changes in operating income, return on sales, and return on assets for the sample firms are -107%, -114%, and -92%, respectively. During this same period, the control-adjusted changes in the level of return on sales and return on assets are -13.78% and -2.32%, respectively. Relative to controls, firms that experience glitches report on average 6.92% lower sales growth, 10.66% higher growth in cost, and 13.88% higher growth in inventories. More importantly, firms do not quickly recover from the negative economic consequences of glitches. During the two-year time period after the glitch announcement, operating income, sales, total costs, and inventories do not improve. We also find that it does not matter who caused the glitch, what the reason was for the glitch, or what industry a firm belongs to--glitches are associated with negative operating performance across the board.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20110367,Management Science,10.2307_20110367,Management & Organizational Behavior,2005.0,0,1.2356436855043285e-05,1,0.9994089603424072,0,0.0002004460693569854
39,,,,Does Strategy Pay?,"Empirical research on the relation between strategy and performance is rarely conclusive. This paper reviews a number of such studies, and suggests that while the links between planning or market share and performance have been fairly clearly established for certain circumstances or time periods, the results for diversity or merger are much more equivocal. Further, it suggests that even `established' results are of little help to strategists, and that the unanswered questions relating to empirical studies must continue to limit their usefulness for strategic planning.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2487191,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_2487191,Management & Organizational Behavior,1983.0,0,1.2145651453465689e-05,1,0.9992541670799255,0,0.004712953697890043

44,,,,How Advanced Is the Strategy Paradigm? The Role of Particularism and Universalism in Shaping Research Outcomes,"As the field of strategy reaches its 25th anniversary, we examine how far the field has progressed during that time. Both management and strategy research have been characterized as being in an early stage of development. We draw on Kuhn's (1996) paradigm development model, which posits a connection between a field's stage of maturity and research processes and outcomes, to assess the maturity of the strategy field. We conduct two studies. The first is a cross-discipline comparison of productivity norms for university faculty. The second study examines longitudinal research outcomes for a sample of 945 strategy faculty. Our results indicate that strategy has the attributes of both an early stage and mature field: while overall research norms are low relative to other fields, they are driven far more by merit-based than non-merit factors.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20142272,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_20142272,Management & Organizational Behavior,2005.0,0,0.1491122841835022,0,0.0004060468927491456,0,0.004179399460554123

47,,,,Economic Design of Control Charts with Different Control Limits for Different Assignable Causes,"The use of multiple control limits and multiple corresponding levels of response for processes is an effective way for statistical process control when different assignable causes exist which lead to different out-of-control states of the processes, and different restoration procedures. This paper examines the optimal economic design of such process control charts. The exact mathematical model is developed and the expected cost per time unit function is derived. The costs associated with the statistical process control are minimized by means of an optimization procedure involving a quasi-Newton method and a Fibonacci lattice search. Sensitivity analysis performed on a large number of numerical examples reveals key relationships between model parameters. A comparison between the proposed control chart and an approximate matched single-cause chart shows that the former can be a significant improvement over the latter.

49,,,,Stocking Repair Kits for Systems with Limited Life,"In this paper we examine several models for systems subject to both repairable and nonrepairable failures. A repairable failure can be remedied by the application of a repair kit (spare part, standby system, etc.), whereas a nonrepairable failure terminates the life of the system. The stochastic properties of key system parameters are derived under appropriate assumptions. These results are then used to determine the optimal number of repair kits to stock in order to maintain a system having a specified cost structure. The applicability of such models to problems of systems design is illustrated in several examples. Our results make use of distributions of phase type, and demonstrate that this family of distributions provides considerable flexibility and computational tractability in reliability modeling.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631355,Management Science,10.2307_2631355,Management & Organizational Behavior,1983.0,0,2.3286887881113216e-05,0,0.0002265589719172567,0,0.0006360966945067048
