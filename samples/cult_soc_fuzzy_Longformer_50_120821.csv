0,,,,THE TIBETAN CULTURAL PRAXIS: BODHICITTA THOUGHT TRAINING,"Over twelve centuries of Buddhist civilization, the Tibetan people have developed a comprehensive system of ethical practices which they employ to train themselves in ""the altruistic mind of enlightenment"" (bodhicitta). These ethical practices are based in large part on epistemological investigations which are aimed at disclosing the nature of understanding and the structure of perception, philosophical investigations which have much in common with Western philosophical traditions, including Phenomenology. Where the Phenomenologists pursue such inquiries without extensive consideration of the ethical consequences they might have, the Tibetan philosophers are concerned with applying these philosophical insights to ethical domains, providing for their ethical practices a sound philosophical basis, in addition to the religious basis they also have. This cultural praxis of the Tibetans is not merely a relic of South Asian civilization recorded in written texts, but constitutes a body of ordinary practices for the Tibetan people.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23262661,Humboldt Journal of Social Relations,10.2307_23262661,Sociology,1986.0,0,0.00016018432506825775,0,0.00020082620903849602,0,0.0019346715416759253,0.7491468787193298,1
1,,,,Marital Dissolution and Work Disability: A Longitudinal Study of Administrative Data,"This study uses Norwegian administrative data in an analysis of sick leaves and receipt of health-related benefits over a period of five years surrounding marital dissolution. Expanding the literature on the poorer health of divorced compared with married individuals, it examines previously unexplored indicators of poor health and employs data collected at more frequent intervals than most prior studies. Results indicate that the selection of the less healthy into the divorced status is more important than health problems that result from marital dissolution itself; moreover, the latter effect is relatively short-lived. These results vary, however, by age, gender, and the presence of children, with stronger, negative effects of divorce found among parents and young men. Our findings are compared with the results from studies utilizing more conventional measures of health from survey data.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3559519,European Sociological Review,10.2307_3559519,Sociology,2005.0,0,1.2982095540792216e-05,0,0.0007749610813334584,1,0.933169424533844,0.9997401833534241,1

5,,,,The Social Construction of Alaska Native Vulnerability to Climate Change,"The effects and severity of anthropogenic climate change are being increasingly realized, with international efforts through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) aimed at mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation to current and future changes. Many of these adaptation measures focus on helping communities in developing nations, grounded in an inter-national framework that notes national disparities in responsibility and impact. While consideration of international inequality is an important and salient framework, it can have the unintentional effect of masking intra-national inequality, and eclipsing the role that factors such as race, class, and gender also play in shaping individual and community vulnerability to climate change. To highlight the role of such social factors in vulnerability, this paper looks at the Alaska Native village of Kivalina, an Inupiat community that must relocate due to climate change. It will be argued that while Kivalina shares many similarities with other global communities heavily impacted by climate change, due to common historic injustices, Kivalina also faces unique challenges by being located in the US, including longstanding resistance by US government and corporate interests to recognizing and acting on climate change, lack of adaptation measures, and cuts to federal disaster management. These challenges raise questions about how governments in ""developed"" countries can be held accountable when they do not adequately assist their people in danger from climate change.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43496860,"Race, Gender & Class",10.2307_43496860,Sociology,2012.0,0,9.677011803432833e-06,0,0.0006432493100874126,1,0.9972510933876038,0.9999790191650391,1
6,,,,EROTOMETER : A TECHNIQUE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF HETEROSEXUAL LOVE,"Although there are myriads of definitions of love in literature, philosophy, psychology, religion, sociology, and other fields, we have no quantitative technique for the measurement of heterosexual love. Therefore, the present study was aimed at the construction of such an instrument. The method employed was the Likert scaling technique, and the survey of opinions resulted in 500 items, which were derived from three sources (the literature of various disciplines, a heterogeneous group of 350 Americans, and the author himself), and which covered 18 components of heterosexual love (respect, loyalty, moral support, empathy and sympathy, sacrifice, communication, companionship, cooperation, security, physical love, and so forth). The criterion of internal consistency gave a final scale of 50 highly discriminatory statements, with a theoretical range of scores from 0 (absence of love) to 100 (complete love). A series of statistical tests enabled the writer to state the ""principle of instrumental parsimony ;"" that is, ""scientific instruments are not to be complicated without necessity"" Four tests involving happily married persons, engaged subjects, casual dates, and broken dates established the validity of the instrument. (For all values, pl. 001. Two test-retests and three split-halves also revealed the scale's reliability (all coefficients, pl. 001). The Erotometer may be employed by researchers in order to test various hypotheses and theories regarding heterosexual love ; by counselors in order to explore more systematically an important sector of a client's life; by teachers in order to facilitate relevant discussion in class; and by individual subjects in order to ascertain the nature, extent, and development of their heterosexual love.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41495916,International Review of Sociology,10.2307_41495916,Sociology,1971.0,0,1.408108710165834e-05,0,0.00024808550369925797,0,0.0005015259957872331,0.9986990690231323,1

10,,,,Social Welfare System,"The social welfare system in Korea has become a public issue recently. Before the 1997 financial crisis, policy makers as well as the general public were mainly interested in pursuing economic growth and largely downplaying welfare needs. In the wake of the crisis, however, the demand for welfare increased significantly, and this in turn has brought changes in the welfare structure, along with an expansion in welfare expenditures. This paper highlights the features of the Korean welfare system in terms of social insurance, pubic assistance, and social service. It examines the basic limitations and key issues surrounding the system. It compares the size of social welfare expenditures in Korea to other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (hereinafter the OECD) countries.

12,,,,The Perils of Single Life in Contemporary Japan,"A comparison of mortality patterns by marital status in 16 industrialized countries revealed that levels of mortality experienced by single Japanese have been staggeringly high in comparison with those of married Japanese or of singles elsewhere. In this paper, we use a variety of data sources to explore several explanations for the Japanese mortality pattern. Evidence from anthropological studies and attitudinal surveys indicates that marriage is likely to have been and probably continues to be more selective with regard to underlying health characteristics in Japan than elsewhere. However, causal explanations related to the importance of marriage and the family in Japanese society probably contribute to the excess mortality of the single population.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/352968,Journal of Marriage and Family,10.2307_352968,Sociology,1993.0,0,1.8946529962704517e-05,0,0.0004874078731518239,1,0.9699977040290833,0.9999977350234985,1

14,,,,GLOBAL CAPITALISM AND IRAQ: THE MAKING OF A NEOLIBERAL STATE,"The 2003 invasion of Iraq and its subsequent occupation effectively erased the country's existing political and economic system, turning Iraq into a tabula rasa. The initial invasion of Iraq, beyond geo-political and other conjunctural explanations, and at a more explanatory structural level, was a response by the United States to transnational crises of over accumulation. One of the central goals of invading Iraq was to more fully integrate the country into the global capitalist system. The occupation regime attempted to formally integrate Iraq into the global economy by imposing a hyper neoliberal legal framework and policies that effectively transnationalized the Iraqi state and facilitated the development of new transnational accumulation circuits in Iraq. This article details this by analyzing the 112 laws that were imposed by the American occupation in Iraq as well as the permanent constitution that was passed in 2005. It shows that these laws opened Iraq to investors irrespective of its national origins. It concludes that this is evidence of the U.S. acting on behalf of transnational, rather than national economic interests.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43499905,International Review of Modern Sociology,10.2307_43499905,Sociology,2014.0,0,0.004268394783139229,0,0.0001624461729079485,0,0.003605474950745702,0.9999992847442627,1
15,,,,"School Size, Social Capital, and Student Victimization","This study assesses the effects of three aspects of school organization—student enrollment, student-teacher ratio, and the number of different students taught—on the property and personal victimization experiences of students. It hypothesizes that smaller schools, schools with lower ratios of students to adults, and schools in which the number of different students taught by the typical teacher is lower will produce less victimization because of the increased social capital to which students in these schools are exposed. Using data from the National Study of Delinquency Prevention in Schools, the authors find that, net of individual-level risk factors and confounding characteristics of schools and their surrounding communities, each of the three aspects of school organization is related to student victimization but that these effects vary across victimization type. Their research suggests that reducing the ratio of students to teachers and reducing the number of different students taught by the average teacher are likely to reduce student victimization. Reducing school size is not. The authors also find evidence that higher levels of social capital, as measured by student consensus about normative beliefs, partially mediate the effects of student-teacher ratio on personal victimization.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23057036,Sociology of Education,10.2307_23057036,Sociology,2011.0,0,1.3444197065837216e-05,0,0.00033021694980561733,1,0.9928663969039917,0.9999957084655762,1
16,,,,Work and the Conduct of Life: Weber's Legacy,"The article examines the role of work in Weber's oeuvre. Work is not a central concept for Weber but he did write extensively on the subject, and the article organizes his writings into four domains: the organization of work, occupation and social stratification, work and political community, and finally, work, personality and life style. This analytical and empirical interest in labor and labor regimes was embedded in his major problem–the rise of the West, and his analytical framework involved the study of economy, polity and culture. The article discusses Weber's problem, sets out his analytical frame of reference, and reconstructs his major empirical studies as well as the famous 'Protestant Ethic' studies where the objective and subjective aspects of work and its meaning are particularly prominent.

In survey research, conducted in Łódź (N = 1,000) and in urban areas in Poland (N = 1,219), respondents were asked to assess whether they and their family members had enough money to cover expenses related to basic needs. On this basis the measure of subjective deprivation was constructed and the resultant variable examined. The results show that this variable constitutes an important indicator of actual economic hardship and is related to various dimensions of the social structure. Location of individuals in the social structure, their demographic characteristics, and their psychological attributes are important predictors of the likelihood of becoming extremely deprived.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20628655,International Journal of Sociology,10.2307_20628655,Sociology,2002.0,0,4.210841780150076e-06,0,0.00015939585864543915,0,0.3200226426124573,0.9999916553497314,1
19,,,,What is Social Capital? A Comprehensive Review of the Concept,"Social capital is an old concept but it entered into academic and policy debates only in 1990s. Its importance in explaining economic and social phenomena have been increasingly felt in recent years. Literature on theoretical and empirical aspects of social capital grew significantly during last decade. The whole notion of social capital is centred on social relationships and its major elements include social networks, civic engagement, norms of reciprocity, and generalised trust. Broadly speaking, it is defined as a collective asset in the form of shared norms, values, beliefs, trust, networks, social relations, and institutions that facilitate cooperation and collective action for mutual benefits. It is a complex multidimensional concept having different dimensions, types, and levels of measurement. Common types of social capital include: structure and cognitive; bonding, bridging, and linking; strong and weak; and horizontal and vertical. It can be measured and analysed at individual- and collective-levels in terms of social perspective and micro-, meso- and macro-levels in terms of geographic perspective. The properties of social capital, such as capacity to appear in as an explanatory variable in the production function, accumulation over time, capability of improving economic performance, investment with expected future returns, convertibility, and the need of maintenance, make it qualify as a form of capital, though there are some criticisms about the use of term 'capital' in social capital. Research on social capital remains in its initial stage and the concept is still elusive, prone to contextual definition, deficient in common measurement indicators, inability to explicitly quantify effects, and subject to various criticisms. Conceptual and measurement imprecision has led the concept prone to vague interpretation, less empirical application, and underestimation of its value. More empirical studies and testing of the concept on the ground is needed to develop a commonly accepted definition and measurement indicators that can explicitly disentangle and quantify its effects on overall development processes. Better conceptualisation and operationalisation of social capital theory is helpful to attract more investment on its development, design appropriate social policies, and promote sustainable development.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23655211,Asian Journal of Social Science,10.2307_23655211,Sociology,2009.0,0,4.213897045701742e-05,0,0.000281022978015244,0,0.00020740795298479497,0.996195912361145,1
20,,,,Marcuse and the Quest for Radical Subjectivity,"In this paper, I maintain that the Marcuse anticipates the poststructuralist critique of the subject, that these critiques suggest that the concept of the subject contains too much philosophical and political baggage, and that we need a reconstructed notion of subjectivity that Marcuse and the Frankfurt School initiated and enable us to further develop. In drawing on Nietzsche, Freud, and aesthetic modernism, Marcuse posits a bodily, erotic, gendered, social, and aestheticized subjectivity that overcomes mind-body dualism, avoids idealist and rationalist essentialism, and is constructed in a specific social milieu and is challenged to reconstruct itself and emancipate itself from limited and oppressive forms. In following Marcuse's reconstruction of subjectivity, I'll accordingly, first, offer a re-reading of Eros and Civilization to demonstrate how it anticipates the poststructuralist critique of the subject and offers an alternative conception of subjectivity. Then I pursue some of the contributions to rethinking subjectivity in Marcuse's later writings, focusing on his notion of radical subjectivity. At stake is developing a reconstructed Marcusean theory of subjectivity which emphasizes the need for a transformation of the affective dimension, the sensibility, and our very conception of the subject to help create a reconstructed conception of subjectivity for contemporary theory and to provide conceptions of the subjective conditions for radical social change and of agency in order to promote individual and social transformation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23250102,Social Thought & Research,10.2307_23250102,Sociology,1999.0,0,0.2895525395870209,0,0.00014926599396858364,0,0.0005503914435394108,0.9962683320045471,1
21,,,,Czechoslovakia in the Middle of Transition,"The article deals with the processes of the Czechoslovak transition from a soviet-type society to a democratic and liberal one. The transition is composed of three main, mutually interacting processes: 1. the constitutional change, i.e. the transformation of the political system and state identity, 2. the change of the economic system, i.e. the transformation of the planned economy into a market economy, and 3. the formation of a civil society out of an authoritarian and closed society. The relationship between the three mentioned changes belongs among the main problems of transformation. The coordination, harmonization and sequencing of the three transformations are being carried out without any previous experience and without the possibility of experimentation, or the time for careful testing of different options. The stabilization of the constitutional framework belongs among the preconditions for successful economic transformation. The Czechoslovak transition to a democratic society and market economy is complicated by unresolved problems in the constitutional sphere, i.e. by the unresolved relationship between the Czech and Slovak republics. The definite test of the success of the transition will be the formation of civil society. It is a long term process which will probably last many decades. It is the most complicated and precarious part of the transformation and is hampered by the value syncretism of the population, by efforts to combine opposing rules of social and economic behavior. The success of the transition depends to a large degree on the ability to mobilize the inner resources of the country. The mobilization processes are socially and culturally conditioned ones.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41133192,Czechoslovak Sociological Review,10.2307_41133192,Sociology,1992.0,0,3.792742427322082e-05,0,0.0013743757735937834,0,0.0010877251625061035,0.993425726890564,1
22,,,,CREATING MEASURES OF THEORETICALLY RELEVANT NEIGHBORHOOD ATTRIBUTES AT MULTIPLE SPATIAL SCALES,"Accurately measuring attributes in neighborhood environments allows researchers to study the influence of neighborhoods on individual-level outcomes. Researchers working to improve the measurement of neighborhood attributes generally advocate doing so in one of two ways: improving the theoretical relevance of measures and correctly defining the appropriate spatial scale. The data required by the first, ""ecometric"" neighborhood assessments on a sample of neighborhoods, are generally incompatible with the methods of the second, which tend to rely on population data. In this article, the authors describe how ecometric measures of theoretically relevant attributes observed on a sample of city blocks can be combined with a geostatistical method known as kriging to develop city block—level estimates across a city that can be configured to multiple neighborhood definitions. Using a cross-validation study with data from a 2002 systematic social observation of physical disorder on 1,663 city blocks in Chicago, the authors show that this method creates valid results. They then demonstrate, using neighborhood measures aggregated to three different spatial scales, that residents' perceptions of both fear and neighborhood disorder vary substantially across different spatial scales.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43551720,Sociological Methodology,10.2307_43551720,Sociology,2014.0,0,5.3753192332806066e-05,0,0.0002286494564032182,0,0.37294313311576843,0.9999983310699463,1

25,,,,How the Birth of a Child Affects Involvement with Stepchildren,"This study investigates the effect of childbearing on parental involvement in stepfamilies and intact families, based on the reports of 1,905 stepparents and biological parents from the National Survey of Families and Households. Regression analysis indicates that involvement with children declines over time, especially among respondents with only stepchildren in the household. Respondents who have had a child between waves of the survey reduce parental involvement at a slower rate than respondents who did not have a child. These effects are explained by the children's age.

26,,,,Walking the Dog: The Effect of Pet Ownership on Human Health and Health Behaviors,"This analysis explores whether pet owners have better physical health outcomes, and if so, whether the positive physical health benefits are explained by better health behaviors that result from having to take care of the pet's physical needs. Data come from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a representative sample of the non-institutionalized United States population. Analyses were limited to persons living alone (n = 2,474) in order to isolate primary pet caretakers from those merely living in a pet household. Results showed that pet owners, particularly dog and cat owners, had more positive physical health outcomes when compared to non pet owners or those owning other types of pets. Surprisingly, the effect of pet ownership was not mediated by health behaviors such as recreational walking. However, the health benefits of pet ownership were largely reduced once sociodemographic variables such as age, socioeconomic status, and residential location were controlled. The positive health effects of pet ownership appear to be primarily the result of selection, not increased physical activity associated with the active caretaking of pets.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24720847,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_24720847,Sociology,2014.0,0,1.3451995982904918e-05,0,0.0013072086730971932,0,0.031324002891778946,0.9982692003250122,1
27,,,,THE DYNAMICS OF THE LABOR PROCESS IN THE AGE OF NEOLIBERAL CAPITALIST GLOBALIZATION: A CLASS ANALYSIS,"This paper examines the nature and dynamics of the labor process in the U.S. and the global economy, focusing on relations between labor and capital at the point of production. Analyzing this process in the context of the global economy, the paper argues that changes in the international division of labor have brought transformations in capitalist relations on a world scale, and that these changes can best be understood through a class analysis of the global capitalist system in which the labor process takes place. Given the class contradictions of global capitalism based on control and exploitation of labor, the struggle between labor and capital ends up becoming a struggle for state power - a struggle that is accelerated and is more intense in its scope and duration in the age of neoliberal capitalist globalization.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41421399,International Review of Modern Sociology,10.2307_41421399,Sociology,2011.0,0,1.6062896975199692e-05,0,0.00011658446601359174,0,0.0013396305730566382,0.9968042373657227,1

If so, is this relationship evidence of pure discrimination, or can it be explained by considering nonracial neighborhood traits? These questions derive their importance from the link between mobility patterns and residential segregation, and the consequent relationship between high levels of segregation and a host of deleterious outcomes. I assess the magnitude and motivations of racial aversion by conducting a hedonic price analysis of geocoded data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.

34,,,,"Creating Emotional Resonance: Interpersonal Emotion Work and Motivational Framing in a Transgender Community
","In this article, we examine how interpersonal emotion work in a transgender support group and motivational framing of transgender social movement organizations together constructed favorable conditions for emotional resonance. We define emotional resonance as the emotional harmony and/or disjuncture between collective action frames and the emotional lives of potential recruits. Data derive from fieldwork, interviews, online e-mail lists and forums, community publications, activist speeches, and social movement organizations' recruitment appeals. Transgendered people joined support groups hoping to find relief from shame, fear, powerlessness, alienation, and inauthenticity. Although group members' emotion work partly accomplished such relief, it was hindered by identity conflicts and the temporal bounds of the meetings. Transgender activists and nascent social movement organizations, however, used motivational framing to promise targeted recruits a more permanent emotional resolution—one which could draw them into the movement. Our analysis moves transgender scholarship beyond issues of identity and moves framing theory beyond an almost exclusive concern with cognitive processes.

35,,,,Redevelopment from Crisis to Crisis: Urban Fixes of Structural Adjustment in Argentina,"Structural adjustment, as one of the primary vectors of neoliberal globalization in the global South since the 1980s, has a record of creating widespread, rapid socioeconomic change in most countries. But research on the politics of its particularly localized, urban manifestations is rare. This article focuses on two cases of crisis-driven redevelopment in the capital of Argentina to ask how state-led urban intervention occurs within a context of structural adjustment, and how this varies in different crisis moments. Evidence is comparative-historical, based on archival material, ethnographic research over 18 months in Argentina, and extensive interviews with strategic informants in Buenos Aires. Although research on redevelopment and neoliberal globalization in Northern countries is extensive, virtually none addresses their joint dynamics in the very different political-economic contexts of the South. I show that the particularities of evolving structural adjustment influence how local redevelopment interventions take shape with different aims, tools, and outcomes in Buenos Aires between 1989 and 2004.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41035620,Berkeley Journal of Sociology,10.2307_41035620,Sociology,2007.0,0,1.71111969393678e-05,0,0.08182968199253082,0,0.004457245115190744,0.9999017715454102,1

Social factors, such as religion, may influence utilization rates by expanding access, offering information, and increasing motivation. The current study examines the relationship between religious involvement, religious beliefs, and mammography usage in a nationally representative sample of Presbyterian women (N = 1,070). We use multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the influence of religious service attendance and two health-related religious beliefs on self-reported mammography use. The findings show that religious attendance is significantly associated with mammogram use. Women who attend services nearly every week are almost twice as likely to use mammograms compared to women who attend services less frequently or never. Furthermore, the belief that spiritual health is related to physical health is also associated with the use of mammograms.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4621938,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_4621938,Sociology,2006.0,0,1.5206665921141393e-05,0,0.4110977053642273,0,0.001050446880981326,0.9874524474143982,1

Comparisons between the responses of husbands and wives who plan to have one but not more than two children, where both are presently employed on a full-time basis, reveal that they agree at a reasonably high level with each other (agreement between members of each married couple) in ranking the beliefs and values tapped by this scale. There are, however, significant differences in the strengths of the beliefs and values of husbands as a group and wives as a group. Husbands perceive having children from a more idealistic or romantic perspective than do wives, husbands wish to have a son more than do wives, and husbands also perceive themselves as being exposed to stronger social pressures to have children than do wives.

Statistically significant differences exist among almost all faculty subgroups with respect to their acceptance of the values associated with the professional ideology as this acceptance is affected by the religious dimension of Catholic higher education.

In this case study we examine a neighborhood, the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, New York, in which there is a concentration of poor people living in close proximity to blue-collar jobs. However, few local residents hold local jobs in the private sector. A survey of local employers revealed that most Red Hook jobs were filled via social networks that exclude local residents. Local residents, particularly African Americans, often lacked the social capital - connections and references - needed to obtain these jobs. Further, many local employers considered Red Hook residents undesirable employees for a variety of reasons including ""place discrimination"" as well as racial discrimination. By contrast, public sector employers often preferred local residents, although their ability to hire them was limited by formal educational requirements. These findings lead us to question the efficacy of policies, such as ""empowerment zones,"" that assume that bringing jobs closer to where poor people live will necessarily improve their employment opportunities.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3096997,Social Problems,10.2307_3096997,Sociology,1996.0,0,2.1426345483632758e-05,0,0.00021554663544520736,1,0.9986108541488647,0.9822069406509399,1

Theil (1967) and Shorrocks (1980) pointed out two important requirements for subgroup decomposable inequality indices. Shorrocks (1980) has shown that Theil's mean logarithmic deviation, for which the weights of subgroup terms are respective population shares, is the only relative inequality index that fulfils these two properties. In this paper we show that the variance is the only absolute inequality index to satisfy the population share weighted subgroup decomposability property, which in turn implies that it also meets the two properties suggested by Theil and Shorrocks.

Therefore, treating secularization as a general ""decline of religion"" is hardly meaningful. This recognition will make it possible to make sense of the fact that ""Christianity"" and secularization have sometimes increased together.

Prior evidence for this association is mixed, however. This analysis explores the possibility that the effect of wives' labor force supply and educational attainment on marital dissolution varies across historical periods and across the marital life course. Event-history analyses of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for 3,523 married couples observed between 1969 and 1993 reveal that the impact of wives' employment on marital dissolution has become increasingly positive. Moreover, as marriages age, the positive effect of wives' employment on divorce becomes stronger and the negative impact of wives' education becomes weaker. Possible explanations for these varying effects include the development of institutional supports for unmarried working mothers, the increasing adoption of nontraditional gender-role ideologies, and trends in workplace sex segregation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657416,American Sociological Review,10.2307_2657416,Sociology,2001.0,0,6.2354097281058785e-06,0,0.005445278715342283,1,0.9939215183258057,0.9980149269104004,1

The Rise and Development of Basque Nationalism in the Light of Social Movement Theory","Nationalism and social mobilization are two of the most prominent areas of research within the social sciences since the end of the Second World War. Yet, the scholarly specialization has so far impeded a mutual exchange of the theoretical and methodological literatures of both areas. While theorists on nationalism dispute about the validity and scientific efficacy of approaches such as primordialism, perennialism, modernism, functionalism or-more recently-ethno-symbolism, scholars concerned with social movement theory have been divided about approaches commonly known as resource mobilization, political process, framing, or new social movement theories. The recent proposal forwarded by McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly (MTT) in their book Dynamics of Contention is an important attempt to overcome the scholarly specialization by presenting a new explanatory framework that aims at opening new analytical perspectives to a better comprehension of contentious politics beyond the ""classic social movements agenda."" This article on the rise and development of Basque nationalism, however, while accepting the proposal as a valid focus for the macro-analysis and comparison of broad structures and processes, is rather sceptical as far as its hypothetical productivity on the theoretical meso-level (analysis and comparison of one or a few single cases) is concerned. Instead, in the light of the historical evolution of Basque nationalism since the end of the nineteenth century, including its more recent violent dimension, it is suggested that a productive and intelligent combination of approaches coming from both areas: theories on nationalism and on social movements, is still a useful and necessary task to carry out in order to facilitate a better understanding of nationalism in particular and contentious politics in general.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4144875,Theory and Society,10.2307_4144875,Sociology,2004.0,1,0.925313413143158,0,0.00029590772464871407,0,0.0004950753645971417,0.9999995231628418,1
