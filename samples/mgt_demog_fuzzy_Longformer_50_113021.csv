,,,Sticky Aspirations: Organizational Time Perspective and Competitiveness,"Managers evaluate the organizational performance by comparing it with historical aspiration levels, and are more likely to make strategic changes when the performance falls below the aspiration level. Historical aspiration levels can be updated with different speed, because a focus on current performance will lead to quickly adjusting aspiration levels where historical performance has low weight, while a focus on past performance will lead to slowly adjusting performance levels where the current performance has low weight. A simulation model of aspiration-level learning and strategic change under uncertainty yields the following findings: (1) Slow adjustments of an aspiration level gives higher performance across different levels of environmental uncertainty, (2) slow adjustments of aspirations will dominate in populations with different adjustment levels if low-performing organizations are removed and replaced by organizations of the form currently performing best, and (3) stronger selection leads to faster domination by slow adjusters. Empirical analysis of format changes in radio stations finds slow adjustment of aspiration levels to be prevalent, and finds slower adjustment in competitive markets, as predicted.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3086063,Organization Science,10.2307_3086063,Management & Organizational Behavior,2002.0,0,1.3906811545894016e-05,1,0.6288113594055176,1,0.8839653730392456

,,,Embracing Jazz: Exploring Audience Participation in Jazz Music in Its Birthplace,"Jazz is an American art form that has become a reflection of universal passions, emotions and the human experience. However, American audience participation for the art form is declining. New Orleans has long been heralded as the birthplace of jazz, and although jazz music can be heard at various venues as well as music festivals throughout the city, local audiences do not make up the majority at venues dedicated to jazz performance. This study examines barriers to audience participation for jazz music. Specifically, audience participation in New Orleans is explored using the Motivation, Ability, Opportunity model as a guiding framework. Empirical evidence, consisting of residents' insights concerning jazz and possible barriers to participation, was gathered via in-depth interviews. Further, drawing from the literature on consumer engagement and brand experience, a model is proposed to address how such barriers might be overcome through strategic marketing efforts that create meaningful and engaging jazz consumption experiences. Le jazz est une forme d'art américaine qui a su refléter les passions, les émotions et l'expérience humaine. Cependant, la participation du public américain à cet art est en déclin. La Nouvelle-Orléans est reconnue pour être le berceau du jazz, et bien qu'il soit possible d'entendre cette musique dans divers lieux de la ville tels que les festivals de musique, le public local ne constitue pas la majorité dans les lieux dédiés aux spectacles de jazz. Cette étude examine les barrières à la participation du public aux spectacles de jazz. En particulier, cette participation du public à La Nouvelle-Orléans est examinée à travers le modèle des motivations, des compétences et des occasions, lequel sert de cadre de référence.

However, in research on work-life conflict little attention has been given to contract workers to date. This is rather surprising as there are indications that the specific working conditions of contract workers can have consequences for their work-life conflict. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to reduce the existing research gap by presenting a study which analyzes the antecedents of the work-life conflict of contract workers in the IT and media sectors. Results show that the work-life conflict of contract workers is significantly influenced by working hours and income. Furthermore, the number of younger children has a significant impact on their work-life conflict when regarded in interaction with gender.

This paper empirically examines scale diseconomies in offering employment contracts as an explanation for diseconomies of scale in R&D. The paper argues that small firms more efficiently resolve the severe agency problems of hidden information and hidden behavior in R&D. Small firms more efficiently offer contracts that reward performance than large firms, and consequently, small firms attract and retain engineers with higher ability and skill. Further, small firms through these more performance-contingent contracts induce higher levels of effort than large firms. The study tests and generally confirms these hypotheses using data collected from 912 current and former engineering employees of two large high-technology companies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2633051,Management Science,10.2307_2633051,Management & Organizational Behavior,1994.0,0,1.4476311662292574e-05,0,0.0002451412728987634,1,0.9989275336265564

One factor that has received limited attention in the literature is that of differences in the way men and women network and that the way women network might not only disadvantage their own professional career progression but also put other women at a disadvantage as well. This study explores this phenomenon and specifically looks at how social network size varies with level of trust between parties. Our results suggest women tend to trust each other less in a risky professional environment compared to men. Though women were found to have the same scale social networks, they exhibit a greater reduction in aggregate network size at higher trust levels. We find that women socialize with each other, but when it comes to a matter of risk taking, women exclude each other and prefer to network with men.

The performance measure of interest is the long-run average holding cost and lost sales penalty cost. For a large class of demand distributions, we show that when the lost sales penalty becomes large compared to the holding cost, the relative difference between the cost of the optimal policy and the best order-up-to policy converges to zero. For any given cost parameters, we establish a bound on this relative difference. Numerical experiments show that the best order-up-to policy performs well, yielding an average cost that is within 1.5% of the optimal cost when the ratio between the lost sales penalty and the holding cost is 100. We also propose a heuristic order-up-to level using two newsvendor expressions; in our experiments, the cost of this order-up-to policy is 2.52% higher, on an average, than the best order-up-to policy.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40539156,Management Science,10.2307_40539156,Management & Organizational Behavior,2009.0,0,1.9747907572309487e-05,0,0.014360039494931698,0,0.0003378141555003822
,,,Determinants of the Number of Artworks in Corporate Art Collections,"Corporations have different motivations for collecting art. This study extends the rationale for corporate art collecting to the determinants of the number of artworks in a collection. The authors use comprehensive data on corporations' art-related behaviours and attributes to investigate the relationship between these factors and the size of their collections using multivariate linear regression methodology. They find that corporations that are active in supporting art and communicating with society have significantly larger art collections than those that are not active. Contrary to conventional beliefs, corporations in the financial sector do not have significantly larger collections than corporations in others areas. This study provides empirical evidence indicating that corporations use art collections to respond to social/institutional pressures and communication needs. Les entreprises sont motivées par différents facteurs à collectionner des œuvres d'art. Cette étude ajoute aux raisons de ces collections d'œuvres d'art les déterminants du nombre d'œuvres d'art dans une collection. S'appuyant sur des données détaillées concernant les comportements et les caractéristiques des entreprises en matière d'art, les auteurs explorent la relation entre ces facteurs et la taille de leurs collections au moyen d'une méthode de régression linéaire multiple. Ils observent que les entreprises qui soutiennent l'art activement et qui cherchent à communiquer avec la société possèdent des collections d'œuvres d'art significativement plus grandes que les entreprises qui n'apportent pas leur soutien à l'art. Contrairement à une croyance répandue, les collections d'œuvres d'art des entreprises du secteur financier ne sont pas significativement plus grandes que celles des entreprises d'autres secteurs.

The firms in primary and tertiary industries are found to be liquidity-constrained in their investment decisions. The investment-cash flow sensitivity of the firms in secondary industry indicates that they lost privileged access to credit in the course of China's market transition. However, we find no evidence that financial liberalization resulted in an easing of financing constraints for small- and medium-sized firms.

In addition, instructor, course, and institution-level characteristics were examined as potential correlates of references to EBM. Using a liberal operationalization of EBM (i.e., keywords or phrases that are consistent with evidence-based management principles), results suggest that approximately 25% of core MBA management courses utilize EBM in some form. However, there are substantial differences across categories of course content and depending on whether the instructor has a PhD.

,,,"Economics, Demography and Cultural Implications of Globalization: The Canadian Paradox","In this paper we explore the effects of globalization on Canada's economy and on the political and cultural identities of Canadians. We begin the paper with a description of the economic, technological and social forces which lead to global integration (or ""globalization"") and the removal or reduction of barriers erected by borders. We examine the extent to which these forces have influenced the economy of Canada in the last two decades and its interactions with the rest of the world. In particular, we investigate whether ""globalization"" is manifested by changes in the locus of control and/or extension of the geographical horizons of Canadian economic agents. We conclude that, while the foreign trade component in Canada's GDP has increased significantly, much of the integration process has been regional, not global. The degree of regional integration is especially pronounced in the sector of cultural products where US exports overwhelm Canadian consumption. This is a source of concern for Canadian politicians who fear that Canada is losing its distinct cultural identity. The response to this perceived threat was a complex regime of regulations and subsidies aimed at protecting domestic production of cultural goods and services. These measures, however, had a very limited impact. While production has shifted to an extent from the US to Canada and the gap in exports/imports of cultural products has declined, the contents of the products continue to reflect the tastes of the bigger US market.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40836023,MIR: Management International Review,10.2307_40836023,Management & Organizational Behavior,2004.0,0,0.00035391029086895287,0,0.000845760980155319,0,0.017477398738265038

It first examines the effectiveness of voluntary initiatives based on corporate social responsibility (CSR), but these are found to lack effective implementation mechanisms. Then, the international law regime as it applies to corporations is discussed. Despite conceptual differences about their scope and application, a number of binding human rights and environmental norms do already exist under which corporations can be held to account. These and other evolving norms can be incorporated into national laws, while pursuing a new international treaty as a long-term goal. Third, it considers the adoption of a human rights-based approach and argues that incorporating human rights values, principles, standards, mechanisms and processes in the functioning of the industry could create a win–win situation for communities and corporations.

,,,Optimal Server Allocation in a System of Multi-Server Stations," Consider a closed queueing network (Gordon and Newell 1967) with a set of stations. The service rate at each station is an increasing concave function of the number of jobs at that station. Suppose there also exists a station that has c (≥1) parallel servers, each of which has a fixed service rate. We show that the throughput of this network is an increasing concave function with respect to c. This result is then applied to solve the optimal server allocation problem in a system of multi-server stations with a fixed buffer capacity (for the total number of jobs) at each station. For a single-station system, the simultaneous optimal allocation of both servers and buffer capacity is also studied.

Japan and the United States, as world leaders in the field. are experiencing the early dislocations attendant upon this leadership. The effects of this phenomenon upon labor are now being felt in certain industries, particularly in Japan, and it is expected to become an extremely grave concern for both labor and management in future contract negotiations. Little public sector application for robots has been found.

There were four groups: 15 male and 15 female middle managers, 15 male and 15 female clerical workers. Each participant was examined individually with regard to cardiovascular and neuroendocrine functions and self-reports for 12 consecutive hours under each of two conditions: (1) a normal day at work (9 a.m. - 5 p.m.) and after work (6-9 p.m.), and (2) for the same time period during work-free conditions at home. In addition, everyone was given a videotaped type A-interview and a general health check-up including blood-lipid determination. Attitudes towards work, total workload (including responsibilities outside the paid work) and sex role identity were examined by questionnaires. As expected, all groups showed a moderate increase in cardiovascular and neuroendocrine activity during the day at work. After work, however, interesting group differences emerged, suggesting slower unwinding in female managers. Differences related to occupational level and/or sex were found for autonomy and social support at work, competitiveness, sex role and reported conflict between demands from paid work and other responsibilities.

Using unique data on U.S. mutual funds founded between 1979 and 2005, I examine whether large and mature firms, which are typically associated with lower individual rates of entrepreneurship, are also associated with lower individual rates of intrapreneurship. The findings show that, though employees in large and mature organizations are less likely to transition to entrepreneurship, they nonetheless exhibit a higher propensity to pursue venturing opportunities inside the established firm than employees in smaller and younger firms. The results suggest that the observed negative effect of large, mature organizations on entrepreneurship arises partly due to high rates of intrapreneurship and that the stultification processes in such organizations are far less important than has been generally assumed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43548334,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_43548334,Management & Organizational Behavior,2012.0,0,2.2678064851788804e-05,0,0.0002637339639477432,1,0.9998038411140442

,,,Sources and Consequences of Competitive Inertia: A Study of the U.S. Airline Industry,"This paper investigates the causes and consequences of competitive inertia in the U.S. airline industry. Competitive inertia is defined as the level of activity that a firm exhibits when altering its competitive stance in areas such as pricing, advertising, new product or service introductions, and market scope. Inertia is argued to be driven by managers' incentives to act, their awareness of action alternatives, and the constraints on their capacity to act. These three sources of inertia were assessed, respectively, by past performance and market growth; by competitive experience and the diversity of the market environment; and by company age and size. We found that good past performance contributed to competitive inertia, whereas a diversity of markets discouraged it. Antecedents for inertia differed in tactical versus strategic actions, the former being driven more by performance and market diversity, the latter by growth in markets. These results suggest the operation of two distinct models of organizational learning, one reactive, the other experimental. Although inertia in strategic actions had mildly positive implications for near-term performance, the benefits from inertia in all kinds of actions diminished with increases in market diversity.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393492,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393492,Management & Organizational Behavior,1994.0,0,0.000586960872169584,0,0.00019087739929091185,1,0.9999302625656128
,,,Correlates of Career-Oriented Mentoring for Early Career Managers and Professionals," This study examines several different kinds of correlates of career-oriented mentoring experiences among early career managers and professionals. Survey data were collected from 416 respondents employed in a wide variety of jobs, organizations, and industries. The respondents averaged 30 years of age, and 28 per cent were women. Results indicated that younger, more work-involved respondents from higher socioeconomic origins received more career-oriented mentoring. In addition, managers received more mentoring than professionals, as did those who were higher in the organization hierarchy. While gender of the protégé was unrelated to the amount of career mentoring received, reasons are offered for this result. Various boundary conditions likely to affect mentoring processes are discussed and several directions are recommended for future research on mentoring.

Responses from 117 black and 220 white managers to an empathic questionnaire developed with the aid of a black and white microcosm group were analysed by a variety of multivariate techniques, including simultaneous factor analysis in several populations. Research hypotheses based on intergroup theory predicted different patterns of association among factors for black and white managers and interactions between racial group membership and individual satisfactions in explaining the understanding of racial dynamics.

,,,Impacts of entrepreneurs' stress and family members on SMEs' business success in Serbian family-owned firms,"This paper focuses on micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in Serbia, with a special emphasis on family-owned businesses. The main goal of this research is to analyze family business owners' perception of stress caused by high levels of responsibility and flexible working hours, as well as to analyze the influence of family member employees on the success of a company. This research has confirmed that high levels of responsibility and flexible working hours do not represent important factors for giving up on starting a business. Furthermore, owners perceive these two stressors as ""positive"" stress. The second important result of this study is that a large number of family member employees, and unclear hierarchy between them, can endanger a company's success in terms of annual income and annual turnover.

Private control, larger departmental size, and a greater tendency to work alone were all associated with more dispersed wages; more social contact among departmental members, more democratic and participative departmental governance, and more demographic homogeneity were associated with more equal salary distributions.

,,,The Effects Of Pre-entry Experiences And Socialization Tactics On Newcomer Attitudes And Turnover,"Given the high costs associated with recruiting and training new employees, managers and researchers alike have a pervasive interest in understanding all experiences associated with newcomers' work-related attitudes and behavior. While research has indicated that both pre-entry experiences and post-entry socialization tactics are vital to newcomers' later work attitudes and behaviors, no study to date has examined these two sets of experiences together. As such, this study examines the effects of pre-entry experiences and socialization tactics on newcomers' later work attitudes and turnover. Results suggest that pre-entry experiences, in the form of person-job expectations, are negatively related to turnover. That is, a newcomer's pre-entry expectations of job fit affect later turnover from the organization. Results also suggest that socialization tactics affect post-entry perceptions of job fit and worth, as well as work-related attitudes such as organizational commitment and job satisfaction. In short, both pre-entry experiences and post-entry socialization tactics impact newcomers' later work attitudes and behaviors.

It first gives a review of the multinational team literature. It concludes that nationality diversity is beneficial when it is relevant to a multinational team's task. The study then draws upon two complementary theoretical perspectives: knowledge and legitimacy. It proposes that a heterogeneous STMT nationality composition may enhance subsidiary performance with the effect being stronger in subsidiaries of longer years of operation. Hypotheses were tested in a sample of STMTs from Japanese Multinational Corporations. The study finds that STMT nationality heterogeneity was positively related to subsidiary labor productivity.

,,,Effects of Structural Position on Allocation and Evaluation Decisions for Scientists and Engineers in Industrial R&D,"This paper examines the influence of the structural positions of different demographic groups in the science and engineering labor force on their access to the allocation of favorable work experiences and their effect on decisions about the evaluation of their performance. Our hypotheses challenge assumptions in the management literature that each group will necessarily express ingroup bias and outgroup derogation. Instead, we call attention to the status hierarchy that develops from status construction processes, the prototypicality that emerges from social categorization processes, and a framework of stereotype content that is based on an analysis of structural positions among groups in the society. Using hierarchical linear modeling with survey data from scientists and engineers in research and development in 24 major corporations, we find that U.S.-born white males, who constitute the normative ingroup, receive advantages in both allocation and evaluation decisions from all evaluators, not just from other white men. We also find that normative outgroups (non-male, non-whites, and/or non-U.S. born) receive ambivalent or indifferent more than discriminatory or biased treatment, depending on their structural position in relation to U.S.-born white men, and that these effects are independent of who is doing the rating.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20109916,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_20109916,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,0,0.005673395935446024,0,0.00038904769462533295,1,0.9998757839202881

This paper concerns itself with some aspects of stress that arise within an organisation when changes are occurring for reasons originating within the organisation itself. Such changes may happen for many reasons: purposes of development, the implementation of technological discoveries, administrative needs or the redeoployment of staff, and as a result of pressures from the people who work in the organisation. They may involve alterations to the nature of the actual job, changes of roles and role relationships, movements of people to different positions in the organisation, and changes in its administration. /// McLean (1977) a étudié les effets des changements qui interviennent dans notre monde sur les organisations et les personnes qui y travaillent.

In the first study, analysis of interviews at 11 organizations in which group exit occurred revealed that the process unfolded in six stages: relative harmony, idea development, change, resistance, intense conflict, and exit. Five trigger events-introduction of conflicting ideas, legitimizing them, alarm, polarization of views, and justification-moved the participants through the group exit process. Study 2, conducted in three organizations in which group exit was avoided, revealed a trigger harmonizing event instead of a polarization event and a final dissonant harmony stage, instead of exit.

An analytical model incorporating this feature is developed and found to be reliable in predicting the entire response time distribution for an actual operating system. A computer version of the model coupled with a pattern search routine constitutes the ambulance deployment methodology referred to as CALL (Computerized Ambulance Location Logic). This methodology may be used to find the deployment of ambulances that minimizes mean response time, as illustrated by an application for the City of Los Angeles. CALL was used to select from a possible set of 34 firehouses 14 for the location of emergency ambulances.
