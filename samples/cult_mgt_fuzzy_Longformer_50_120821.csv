0,,,,Sustainable Entrepreneurship in the Apparel Industry: The Case of manomama,"During the last decade, pressure on companies to transcend the focus on economic success and technological innovation in order to address more ecologically and socially desirable outcomes has increased. Commitment to sustainability-oriented innovation is still rare in the textile and apparel industry, but there exist first case examples of highly eco-innovative companies. This article presents an in-depth case study of the sustainable company manomama which manufactures individualised clothes for women, men and children in Southern Germany. Ecologically harmless material, most of which is organic, is procured only regionally, and highly experienced workers from the ancient textile region have been provided with secure full- and part-time jobs. The article discusses the major challenges of manomama when entering business (knowledge and experience, site and machinery, suppliers, staff and supporters) and presents the innovative solutions the founder identified to address these. In addition, the article derives implications for traditional companies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.45.123,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.45.123,Management & Organizational Behavior,2012.0,0,0.0011413758620619774,0,0.0002704263024497777,0,0.0019271437777206302

2,,,,Social Support and Managerial Affective Responses to Job Stress,"This research examines the moderating or buffering effects of two social support variables-support from the work group and from the supervisor-on the relationships of role conflict and ambiguity to intrinsic job satisfaction, job involvement and job anxiety. Data were collected from a sample of 89 middle-lower managerial personnel in a large, heavy equipment manufacturing firm in the Midwest. The moderated regression technique was used in data analysis. Significant interactions were obtained between the role variables and both social support variables. The results were in the predicted direction for positive work outcomes (i.e. job satisfaction and involvement) and contrary to prediction for negative work outcome (i.e. job anxiety). Implications of the findings for future research, the management of stress and leadership behaviour are discussed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3000115,Journal of Occupational Behaviour,10.2307_3000115,Management & Organizational Behavior,1982.0,0,6.945418590476038e-06,0,0.003371620550751686,0,0.006232316140085459
3,,,,The Behavior of Public Managers in Adopting New Technologies,"The development of an information network is a project of prime importance for industrialized countries. Managing a technological change of this magnitude requires many forms of expertise. In such a context, the behavior of managers is an important factor to consider. But, can managers resort to various types of behavior? If so, what impact do these forms of behavior have on the adoption process? A questionnaire was developed to identify the characteristics of managers' behavior in the process of adopting a new technology. It was sent to 600 managers of various public organizations. The study shows that there are many entrepreneurs working in public organizations. It also highlights that there is a positive correlation between consideration of the social component and success in the adoption of new technology, and that entrepreneurs are much less inclined to take this social component into consideration.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3381223,Public Performance & Management Review,10.2307_3381223,Management & Organizational Behavior,2001.0,0,0.0017097146483138204,0,0.00015370536129921675,0,5.117047840030864e-05

5,,,,Churches and statues: Cultural tourism in Finland,"Tourism in Finland is chiefly oriented towards nature, but culture has an important role to play as well. Almost every cultural attraction with more than 100,000 visitors per year is situated in the major cities. Typically, the most popular cultural attraction in the cities is a church or a museum. In the rural areas, almost the only significant attractions are short-term festivals. It seems that successful cultural attractions do require a large population catchment surrounding them. Normally, local residents also enjoy culture attractions.

6,,,,Executive accountability around the World: Sources of cross-national variation in firm performance-CEO dismissal sensitivity,"In this study, the authors investigate why CEOs seem to be held more accountable for poor firm performance in some countries than others. The article integrates research from comparative corporate governance and agency theory to identify and evaluate four fundamental assumptions underlying most theoretical arguments linking performance and dismissal: (1) CEOs are personally responsible for firm performance outcomes; (2) boards/owners have the power to dismiss CEOs; (3) firm performance measures are meaningful; and (4) suitable alternative candidates for the CEO role are available. The authors argue that CEO accountability will vary in line with the extent to which these assumptions are more or less valid from one country to the next. They provide robust evidence - across both marketbased and accounting-based measures - that CEOs are more likely to be dismissed following poor firm performance in countries where managerial discretion is high, where firm performance measures are more meaningful, and where the CEO labor market is more developed. However, the authors do not find support for their prediction that CEO accountability varies in line with cross-national differences in CEO power asymmetry.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43581892,Strategic Organization,10.2307_43581892,Management & Organizational Behavior,2013.0,0,1.8788010493153706e-05,1,0.9997349381446838,0,0.01713395118713379
7,,,,PERCEPTIONS OF ORGANIZATIONAL POLITICS: A META-ANALYSIS OF THEORETICAL ANTECEDENTS,"This study presents a quantitative review of research examining variables thought to influence the development of perceptions of organizational politics (POP). The results provide support for most of the relationships proposed in theoretical models (e.g., Ferris et al., 1989; Ferris et al., 2002). Job/work environment influences are found to have the strongest and most consistent relationship with politics perceptions (e.g., trust, participation in decision-making, leader-member exchange, met expectations, and opportunity for development). Organizational influences which are found to be related to perceptions of organizational politics include centralization, formalization, and procedural justice. Demographic variables are found to have little or no relationship with politics perceptions, although personality variables (i.e., Machiavellianism, locus of control, positive affect, and negative affect) exhibit moderate to moderately strong relationships.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25822527,Journal of Managerial Issues,10.2307_25822527,Management & Organizational Behavior,2010.0,0,4.220347909722477e-05,0,0.0005220319726504385,0,0.0009287414723075926
8,,,,Organizational Hiring Standards,"Organizational hiring criteria help determine which individuals enter organizational labor markets as well as serving as an important component of organizational control systems-more effort placed on screening workers at entry means that less emphasis may be placed on training and socialization or on monitoring them once in the organization. The determinants of organizational selectivity in hiring, including the use of educational credentials, written and unwritten tests, and screening on the basis of workers' characteristics were examined using a sample of 254 establishments in the San Francisco Bay Area. The analyses suggested that hiring standards for different occupations (both white and blue collar) within establishments were positively correlated with each other and were affected by the same set of factors. Formal hiring standards were positively related to the presence of a personnel department, to the amount of training and technological change, and to the presence of an internal labor market. The proportion of the workforce covered by collective bargaining was negatively related to organizational selectivity, and there was no effect of economic sector (core versus periphery) and organizational size once other organizational factors were controlled. The results indicate that hiring standards reflect not only organizations' skill requirements but also the preferences of various groups for such standards and their ability to enforce these preferences.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392763,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392763,Management & Organizational Behavior,1986.0,0,2.769819002423901e-05,0,0.00027012068312615156,1,0.9996594190597534

10,,,,Public Sector Contracting: An Australian Study of Changing Work Conditions,"Throughout the 1990s, government reports such as the Competitive Tendering and Contracting Report (Industry Commission1996) and the Report of the Independent Commission to Review Public Sector Finances (McCarrey 1993), suggested that the contracting-out of government services would improve the delivery of public goods in Australia. This article reports on the findings of a case study of contracting-out of building maintenance services in the state of Western Australia in Australia. The study focuses on evaluating the impact of the contracting-out of these services on the wages and conditions of employees affected by moving from public sector to private sector employment. The study found differences in the employment conditions of white collar and blue collar workers. In general, the conditions of white collar workers improved but there was a marginal decline in the conditions of blue collar workers. The article concludes that while contracting-out created budgetary savings for government, these resulted partly from a reduction in wages and benefits of former blue collar staff, despite the best efforts of the Western Australian government to protect staff wages and benefits. The research makes an important theoretical contribution by arguing that the impact of contracting-out on staff wages, benefits and conditions is conditional upon the level of competition in the labor market for worker's expertise. In ""thick markets"", wages, benefits and conditions are likely to reduce, due to strong competition for expertise. However in ""thin markets"", wages, benefits and conditions are likely to increase, due to weak competition for expertise (Borland, 1994).",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41783501,Management Revue,10.2307_41783501,Management & Organizational Behavior,2005.0,0,9.642098120821174e-06,0,0.00021086877677589655,0,0.0006342224660329521
11,,,,Games Managers Play: Play as a Form of Leadership Development,"In recent years, organizations have expended considerable effort and resources to develop and improve managers' leadership skills through various forms of play. I explore the role of play in leadership development processes. Drawing on theories of leader and leadership development and theories of play, I develop a conceptual framework, suggesting that play can contribute to different components of leader and leadership development processes (i.e., leadership identity, cognitive abilities, and behavioral skills). Furthermore, the role of creating safe play spaces in leadership development processes is highlighted. The discussion examines the implications and applications of play for leadership development processes, points to the dangers of misuse of play, and outlines directions for further empirical research.",external-fulltext-any,Academy of Management Learning & Education,10.2307_41318071,Management & Organizational Behavior,,0,0.00010495610331417993,0,0.00020857123308815062,0,0.0009624641388654709
12,,,,Company Profile: John R. Porter and the Musée du Québec,"Directing a museum devoted to the conservation of national art occasionally requires a rethinking of some of the orientations traditionally associated with museum management. This, at any rate, was the risk that John R. Porter was willing to take in 1993, when he accepted the post of director of the Musée du Québec. The implementation of his vision for the museum led to a substantial increase in attendance over a three-year period. However, while the Musée du Québec now enjoys greater notoriety, the important task of consolidating the museum's financial situation continues, notably through an ongoing effort to renew programming. The author describes how Porter perceives his role at the Musée du Québec, as well as the changes implemented under his leadership and the main events that have contributed, since 1993, to the museum's metamorphosis. La direction d'un musée destiné à la conservation de l'art national oblige parfois à repenser certaines orientations traditionnellement associées à la gestion muséale. C'est du moins le pari qu'a fait John R. Porter en acceptant, en 1993, la direction générale du Musée du Québec. La concrétisation de sa conception du musée a permis d'accroître la fréquentation considérablement en trois ans. Toutefois, si le Musée du Québec jouit maintenant d'une grande notoriété auprès du public, il faut en poursuivre la consolidation financière et, pour ce faire, continuer à en réinventer la programmation. L'auteur décrit comment Porter conçoit son rôle au Musée du Québec, ainsi que les changements entrepris sous sa direction et les principaux événements qui ont contribué, depuis 1993, à la transformation du musée. La administración de un museo de conservación del arte nacional obliga a menudo a reexaminar certas orientaciones tradicionalmente asociadas con la gestión de los museos. Es, por lo menos, la apuesta que se hizo John R. Porter cuando, en 1993, aceptó la dirección general del Museo de Quebec. La concreción de su concepción del museo permitió aumentar considerablemente las entradas en tres años. Sin embargo, aunque el Museo de Quebec goce hoy en día de gran notoriedad entre el público, se debe continuar su consolidación financiera. Para ello, es preciso reinventar continuamente la programación.

13,,,,Dynamic and Risk Measurement Perspectives on Bowman's Risk-Return Paradox for Strategic Management: An Empirical Study,"Bowman's (1980, 1982) widely quoted papers have reported the existence of a risk-return paradox for strategic management. In this paper the authors examine the dynamic behavior of the risk-return relationship and analyze whether the risk-return paradox is stable across time. The analysis involves tracking Bowman's so-called negative association ratio across time. Using accounting measures of risk and return, it is demonstrated that while the paradox holds during the 1970s, the finding does not hold in the environment of the 1960s. Further, the paradox disappears if market-based risk measures are used. Some implications for strategic management are then discussed and attention is directed towards the meaning of risk in the context of strategic management. In addition, possible explanations for this paradox are evaluated and directions for further research are suggested.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486056,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_2486056,Management & Organizational Behavior,1986.0,0,1.5711004380136728e-05,0,0.0002726802777033299,0,0.00021653951262123883

15,,,,Script comparisons during service encounters in fast-food chains,"The purpose of this study was to explore and compare the service encounter cognitive scripts existing between service providers and customers as utilized by fast-food chains. The semi-structured interviews were conducted with customers and employees of fast-food restaurants to examine and record their cognitive script with regard to dining in a fast-food restaurant. The findings suggest that the fast-food industry needs to place greater emphasis on the after counter service in order to make more of an impression on customers in relation to the complete service procedure with regard to service encounter scripts standardized by operators. By defining the differences in scripts that operate between customers and service providers, this offers an opportunity for improving the service encounter within industries oriented toward personal interaction.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23745423,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23745423,Management & Organizational Behavior,2011.0,0,5.867424260941334e-05,0,0.00039713000296615064,0,0.00024452779325656593
16,,,,Does It Matter That the Prosecutor Is Also the Judge? The Administrative Complaint Process at the Federal Trade Commission,"Firms seeking to merge face antitrust scrutiny from either the Department of Justice (DOJ) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Unlike the DOJ, the FTC litigates its cases in front of its own administrative law judges (ALJs), and then hears the appeal itself, rather than using federal district courts. This study focuses on the formal decisions made by the FTC after an ALJ has conducted a full trial for a particular case. We find that while the 'merits' of a matter, as implied by the case law, affect the FTC's decision, institutional factors also have an impact. In particular, the firm's chances of prevailing in litigation are influenced by the number of commissioners who both vote to prosecute and then vote as a judge as well as the political affiliations of the commissioners.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3108306,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_3108306,Management & Organizational Behavior,1998.0,0,1.097786571335746e-05,0,0.011124400421977043,0,0.0001540410885354504
17,,,,FDI in China: What We Know and What We Need to Study Next,"China is the world's fastest growing economy and is the focus of extensive discussion by both academics and businesspeople. One of the principal drivers of China's growth is foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country. China has pursued a historically unique FDI policy that has long-term implications for both Chinese and international businesses. The largest portion of China-related research is focused on FDI in China. This paper looks at what we know from this research and where future research about China and FDI needs to move. This paper will allow academics to build that knowledge of China and FDI into teaching and into a foundation for understanding this dynamic economy. Such an understanding of FDI will also help academics whose expertise is not China to better understand what is unique about China and its economy and lay the foundation for understanding other emerging economies. Using a process framework this paper examines various issues related to FDI in China, including the nature of earlier foreign investments into China, the timing and mode of entry, partner selection decisions, joint venture strategies, interpartner issues, and people issues in FDI.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27747477,Academy of Management Perspectives,10.2307_27747477,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,0,8.166863699443638e-05,0,0.0010562631068751216,0,0.00011068502499256283

19,,,,Earnings Fraud: Board Control vs CEO Control and Corporate Performance — 1992-2004,"The turn of the millennium is associated with increased corporate fraud, largely attributed to the failure of corporate governance. The compensation committee is expected to minimize fraud by rewarding only appropriate CEO behavior. A causal modeling approach, the Directed Acyclic Graph, was used to estimate the structure of corporate fraud. Corporate fraud was measured as illegal earnings statements), not all restatements but only those found illegal. A major finding is that the CEO's stock-option compensation motivates the CEO to commit corporate earnings fraud, while cash salaries and bonuses are only indirectly related to earnings fraud through those stock options.",external-fulltext-any,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_41060635,Management & Organizational Behavior,,0,2.3104130377760157e-05,0,0.0960749164223671,0,5.7170742365997285e-05
20,,,,When Managers Become Philosophers: Integrating Learning with Sensemaking,"My purpose here is to join the scholarly conversation (Huff, 1999) concerning the development of managers (Detrick, 2002; Donaldson, 2002; Pfeffer & Fong, 2002) and to introduce the reader to two similar constructs developed in differing paradigms: sensemaking and learning. Through a review of the characteristics of sensemaking and the conceptual orientations to adult learning, similarities and contradictions emerge. Both constructs deal with the creation of meaning, the necessity for action to be linked with cognition, and the importance of both subjective and objective knowledge. Differences appear with respect to the role of critical reflection and the impact of social structuring on meaning making. Although contradictions emerge, after examining each construct independent of the other, I suggest that the two constructs are actually complementary. To identify this symbiotic relationship, I offer two implications concerning the conceptualization of managerial work and the development of managers.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40214286,Academy of Management Learning & Education,10.2307_40214286,Management & Organizational Behavior,2005.0,0,0.11636064946651459,0,0.0006015875842422247,0,0.00012364887516014278

This paper is concerned with research which addresses the management of the labour process and employment relationships per se. The main focus of the analysis explores the research on issues related to people management published in specialist hospitality and tourism journals, and the analysis is further developed through a comparison of research articles published over the same time period in a generic human resources publication. Comparison of these two sets of journals reveals some interesting similarities and variations in research topics — not the least of which is the general reluctance of hospitality research to critically engage with debates about the meaning and theoretical underpinning of 'human resource management'.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42919208,International Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_42919208,Management & Organizational Behavior,1999.0,0,0.00011786590766860172,0,0.0005235877470113337,0,0.0012629698030650616
22,,,,Organizational Effectiveness and Bureaucratic Red Tape: A Multimethod Study,"Although many efforts to improve the effectiveness of government agencies target bureaucratic red tape, little academic work has evaluated the implications of red tape for organizational performance. This article proposes and tests a model of organizational effectiveness that explicitly accounts for red tape and the mitigating effect of organizational culture. This multimethod study uses both quantitative data from questionnaires and qualitative data from in-depth interviews. Findings suggest that red tape in human resource systems and information systems has a negative effect on organizational effectiveness. However, a dimension of organizational culture, namely developmental, mitigates the negative effects of bureaucratic red tape.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20447639,Public Performance & Management Review,10.2307_20447639,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,0,0.0005810933653265238,0,0.00019231623446103185,0,0.0010775363771244884
23,,,,Identity in Organizations: Exploring Cross-Level Dynamics,"Most research on organization-based identities focuses on a single level of analysis, typically the individual, group, or organization. As a spur to more cross-level identity research, we offer speculative discussions on two issues concerning nested identities. First, regarding the processes through which identities become linked across levels, we explore how identities at one level of analysis enable and constrain identities at other levels. We argue that, for a collective identity, intrasubjective understanding ("" I think"") fosters intersubjective understanding ("" we think"") through interaction, which in turn fosters generic understanding— a sense of the collective that transcends individuals ("" it is""). Second, regarding the content of linked identities, we suggest that identities are relatively isomorphic across levels because organizational goals require some internal coherence. However, for various intended and unintended reasons, isomorphism is often impeded across levels, and identities tend to become somewhat differentiated.",external-fulltext-any,Organization Science,10.2307_41303108,Management & Organizational Behavior,,0,0.0005796879413537681,0,0.015487941913306713,0,0.08707510679960251
24,,,,Survival of Businesses Using Collaborative Relationships to Commercialize Complex Goods,"Authors with many theoretical and managerial perspectives argue that businesses commercializing technologically complex goods benefit when they collaborate closely with other businesses. Collaboration is viewed as a means for businesses to overcome competency limitations and to achieve the close configuration of components required for complex goods. We predict that collaborative relationships often assist businesses to produce complex goods, but that the relationships might also cause problems for the collaborating businesses. We find that firms using development-oriented and marketing-oriented collaborative relationships in the hospital software systems industry are less likely to shut down than businesses that follow independent approaches when the environment changes gradually, but businesses using collaborative relationships are sometimes susceptible to being acquired by other firms. Following a sudden environmental shock, businesses with collaborative relationships for activities central to the shock became more likely to shut down, while businesses with collaborative relationships for activities outside the focus of the shock became more likely to survive. The study critically evaluates and tests the widely stated but little-tested argument that interfirm collaboration is usually beneficial. The results address the issue of whether organizational choices affect comparative business performance.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486844,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_2486844,Management & Organizational Behavior,1996.0,0,9.438010238227434e-06,0,0.0005025818827562034,0,0.004779720213264227

26,,,,Enabling Sustainability through an Action Research Process of Organisational Development,"The purpose of this paper is to report the results of a study exploring a unique learning process leading to ‘leader led’ organisational change with a sample of South African SMEs. The paper investigates a specific developmental methodology designed to enable leaders to explore the structures and processes within their organisations that are most conducive or resistant to the evolution of responsible leadership within a framework of unique emergent sustainability strategies. An action research approach using a structured workbook was adopted to support leaders of SMEs in the discovery, planning and execution of sustainability projects within their organization. The findings indicate that action research is an appropriate process for initiating and supporting new sustainability management practices in organisations. The collective inquiry identified a broadly applicable model of sustainable business underpinned by values-based leadership, open communication and stakeholder engagement. Specifically, the unique priorities and context of each business were important for developing each organisation's concept of sustainability and fostering engagement with sustainability projects. The results offer practical development advice to smaller companies seeking to embed sustainable strategies through responsible leadership. Through a number of action research iterations tangible progress was made in both awareness and implementation of sustainability management in the organisation. The process involved a learning ‘journey’ for the managers involved leading towards organisational change.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.49.137,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.49.137,Management & Organizational Behavior,2013.0,0,0.00015935984265524894,0,0.001810537651181221,0,0.0002312368742423132

28,,,,Strategic Inventory in Capacitated Supply Chain Procurement,"We study the strategic role of inventory in a sequential two-period procurement setting, where the supplier's capacity in the first period is limited and the retailer has the option to hold inventory. We compare the equilibrium under a dynamic contract, where the decisions are made at the beginning of each period, and a commitment contract, where the decisions for both periods are made at the beginning of the first period. We show that there is a critical capacity level below which the outcomes under both types of contracts are identical. When the first period capacity is above the critical level, the retailer holds inventory in equilibrium and the inventory is carried due to purely strategic reasons; as capacity increases, so does the strategic role of inventory. The supplier always prefers lower capacity than the retailer, and the difference between supplier-optimal and supply-chain optimal capacities, and the corresponding profits, can be significant. Finally, we find that the retailer's flexibility to hold inventory is not always good for the participants or for the channel.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25151580,Managerial and Decision Economics,10.2307_25151580,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,0,1.2492769201344345e-05,0,0.00026623334269970655,0,0.00016188641893677413
29,,,,Personality and Charisma in the U.S. Presidency: A Psychological Theory of Leader Effectiveness,"We argue in this paper that in an age of complexity, change, large enterprises, and nation states, leaders are more important than ever. However, their effectiveness depends on their personality and charisma and not solely on their control over bureaucratic structures. We used a study of U.S. presidents to test a general model of leader effectiveness that includes leader personality characteristics, charisma, crises, age of the institution headed by the leader, and leader effectiveness. Age of the presidency accounted for approximately 20 percent of the variance in presidential needs for power, achievement, and affiliation. Presidential needs and a measure of leader self-restraint in using power, the age of the presidency, and crises accounted for 24 percent of the variance in presidential charisma. Age of the presidency, crises, needs, and charisma together predicted from 25 percent to 66 percent of the variance in five measures of presidential performance. Our study demonstrates that personality and charisma do make a difference.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393201,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393201,Management & Organizational Behavior,1991.0,0,2.116150426445529e-05,0,0.0003485838242340833,0,0.015640616416931152
30,,,,The Myopia of Learning,"Organizational learning has many virtues, virtues which recent writings in strategic management have highlighted. Learning processes, however, are subject to some important limitations. As is well-known, learning has to cope with confusing experience and the complicated problem of balancing the competing goals of developing new knowledge (i.e., exploring) and exploiting current competencies in the face of dynamic tendencies to emphasize one or the other. We examine the ways organizations approach these problems through simplification and specialization and how those approaches contribute to three forms of learning myopia, the tendency to overlook distant times, distant places, and failures, and we identify some ways in which organizations sustain exploration in the face of a tendency to overinvest in exploitation. We conclude that the imperfections of learning are not so great as to require abandoning attempts to improve the learning capabilities of organizations, but that those imperfections suggest a certain conservatism in expectations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486499,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_2486499,Management & Organizational Behavior,1993.0,0,6.206090620253235e-05,0,0.00014971414930187166,0,0.00018462975276634097

How extant literature acknowledges Buddhism informing sustainability as an alternative to current business practices predominantly governed by an economic rationale is examined. Thirty journal articles and 20 books/book chapters are analyzed. Commonly discussed Buddhist principles in the literature include the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the Law of Karma, and Compassion. Through the analysis of Buddhist principles, a set of values are derived that enable the possibility of fostering sustainability in organizations. Core values emphasized are interconnectedness, moderation and empathy.

Discussion is limited to two-echelon multi-item systems in which an item may be demanded at any one of several locations called bases; in turn, these bases receive inventory from a central location called a depot. The objectives of the model are to describe the logistics relationship between an assembly and its subassemblies, and to compute spare stock levels for both echelons for the assembly and subassemblies with explicit consideration of this logistics relationship. In particular, the model is used to determine the base and depot spare stock levels which minimize total expected base backorders for the assembly subject to a system investment constraint. An example is given showing how the model can be used to calculate spare engine and engine module stock levels. MOD-METRIC has been implemented by the Air Force as the method for computing recoverable spare stock levels for the F-15 weapon system.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2629628,Management Science,10.2307_2629628,Management & Organizational Behavior,1973.0,0,1.47197388287168e-05,0,0.001426579779945314,0,0.0006295426283031702

38,,,,"Globalisation, Markets, Transnational Corporations and Environmental Management: A Case of Small Island Nations in the South Pacific","The process of globalisation has many implications for developing countries in terms of trade and the performance of their economies. The structural adjustment, global trade and the new political economy of development gave rise to many questions regarding the role of transnational corporations and the performance of the markets. In the case of the South Pacific Island Nations (SPINs), the performance of the markets and the role of transnational firms have been a matter of concern. Dependency theorists have attributed this to the process of colonialism and the exploitation of resources by the transnational firms in the post-independence era. However, in the present circumstances and in view of global trade regimes, developing countries in general have to accept that they are part of the global economy. Therefore, strategies to achieve sustainable levels of economic growth must combine policies that support the operation of the market as well as allow governments to intervene in strategic areas such as the environment. SPINs have very little option but to attract foreign investment to achieve economic growth and foreign investment which largely has to come through the transnational firms. Over the last decade, governments of the SPINs have pursued economic policies that provide incentives to foreign firms to invest in their economies. These policies have often been dictated to by the international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The experiences of these countries with structural adjustment policies have been articulated both in terms of the positive and negative impacts on the poor and the environment. This paper analyses the role of transnational firms in economic growth and the conflict it creates in the process of environmental management and governance in the SPINs. It explores the questions of markets versus government intervention in the management of the economy and the environment.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.2.75,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.2.75,Management & Organizational Behavior,2001.0,0,0.00012860020797234029,0,0.00021160895994398743,0,0.00019386070198379457
39,,,,Cognitive Biases and Organizational Correctives: Do Both Disease and Cure Depend on the Politics of the Beholder?,"The study reported here assessed the impact of managers' philosophies of human nature on their reactions to influential academic claims and counter-claims of when human judgment is likely to stray from rational-actor standards and of how organizations can correct these biases. Managers evaluated scenarios that depicted decision-making processes at micro, meso, and macro levels of analysis: alleged cognitive biases of individuals, strategies of structuring and coping with accountability relationships between supervisors and employees, and strategies that corporate entities use to cope with accountability demands from the broader society. Political ideology and cognitive style emerged as consistent predictors of the value spins that managers placed on decisions at all three levels of analysis. Specifically, conservative managers with strong preferences for cognitive closure were most likely (a) to defend simple heuristic-driven errors such as overattribution and overconfidence and to warn of the mirror-image mistakes of failing to hold people accountable and of diluting sound policies with irrelevant side-objectives; (b) to be skeptical of complex strategies of structuring or coping with accountability and to praise those who lay down clear rules and take decisive stands; (c) to prefer simple philosophies of corporate governance (the shareholder over stakeholder model) and to endorse organizational norms such as hierarchical filtering that reduce cognitive overload on top management by short-circuiting unnecessary argumentation.

Although based on the techniques of mathematical programming, the model does not purport to indicate a single optimum allocation of health and social services resources, but rather to calculate the resource consequences of possible alternative courses of action.

42,,,,An environmental assessment of how technology is reshaping the hospitality industry,"Leading strategists suggest that the key to winning the future is to develop industry foresight and to stake one's territorial claim before anyone else. Following this advice, however, is not as easy as it may sound, especially when one takes into account how quickly things change in the era of high-tech. Each day, the seeds of change are sown. By using disciplined approaches, these seeds can be spotted early on as they germinate, sprout and grow into something big. To help the hospitality industry develop foresight in a disciplined manner, identify the antecedents of change and prepare for the future, the International Hotel and Restaurant Association (IH&RA) called together over 160 people worldwide from various organisations, industries and geographic regions to participate in a series of Visioning Workshops and Technology Think-Tank sessions. Collectively, these sessions define the forces shaping change and identify what is in store for the industry as the future draws near. The findings to date suggest that information technology is the single greatest force affecting change in the hospitality industry. Everywhere one looks, one can find evidence of how technology is reshaping the industry and changing the very dynamics of competition and customer/employee interaction. Going forward, technology will be the most important competitive weapon for any hospitality company. If hospitality organisations want to compete successfully, they must do so by using technology to drive value to both the customer and the firm.

44,,,,Exploring structural embeddedness of product market activities and resources within business units,"This article explores the concept of structural embeddedness and proposes a construct, contextual links, which represent coordination mechanisms applied to activities that may embed activities and their underlying resources within their business units. The main argument is that if activities and resources are highly embedded in unit structures, then unit reconfiguration should have an impact on activity reconfiguration, where reconfiguration refers to movement within the firm and retention or deletion from the firm. Specifically, the article argues that if there is a significant structural embeddedness, then removal from the contextual environment within which activities reside will result in their creating less value. Theoretical support is drawn from the dynamic capabilities and organization design literatures. Activity movements are specified as default, linked, or unlinked changes. The article examines, empirically, the simultaneous effects of activity and unit reconfiguration on activity retention to gain insight on structural embeddedness. It contrasts activity-level and unit-level contextual links; whereas the former refers to activities embedded in units, the latter refers to units embedded in the firm. Findings reveal that preserving activity-level contextual links is more influential than preserving unit-level contextual links in determining value creation from activities and their resources.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43581880,Strategic Organization,10.2307_43581880,Management & Organizational Behavior,2012.0,0,0.0006760103278793395,0,0.0004503898089751601,0,0.002348373644053936

46,,,,The Costs and Benefits of Managerial Incentives and Monitoring in Large U.S. Corporations: When is More Not Better?,"Recent research and public discourse on executive compensation and corporate governance suggests a growing consensus that firms can and should increase their control over top managers by increasing the use of managerial incentives and monitoring by boards of directors. This study departs from this consensus by offering an alternative perspective that considers not only the benefits, but also the costs of both incentives and monitoring in large corporations. The study develops and tests a contingency cost/benefit perspective on governance decisions as resource allocation decisions, proposing how and why the observed levels of managerial incentives and monitoring may vary across organizations and across time. Specifically, the study suggests that: (1) firms that are more risky face greater costs when using incentive compensation contracts for top managers, thus reducing the expected level of incentive compensation use for such firms; (2) firms facing this problem of low incentive compensation use can realize greater benefits from higher levels of board monitoring, and thus are likely to rely more on board monitoring; and (3) firms with more complex corporate strategies face higher costs in using board monitoring, and are thus likely to rely less on board monitoring as a source of controlling top management behavior. The study also proposes that within this contingency perspective there may be diminishing `behavioral returns' to increases in monitoring and incentives. These hypotheses are tested using extensive longitudinal data from over 400 of the largest U.S. corporations. The supportive findings suggest that maximal levels of incentives and monitoring are not necessarily optimal, and that a firm's strategy may not only have significant product/market implications, but also corporate governance implications.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486814,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_2486814,Management & Organizational Behavior,1994.0,0,8.650731615489349e-05,0,0.00010759366705315188,0,9.744917770149186e-05

48,,,,Democracy and Disaster: The Crisis of (Meta) Planning in America,"In this essay we examine the connection between a crisis in the American political economy and the recurrence of industrial crisis which imperil the health, safety and welfare of Americans and others affected by U.S.-based industrial operations. The crisis of the political economy (manifested by uneven growth rates, polarization, voter cynicism and other indicators) arises from the need for increased coordination and planning of economic and industrial activity. This planning threatens elite control and undermines the ideology of laissez faire economics which legitimates the prevailing order. Weak planning and an unstable political consensus are natural results of this contradiction. A system which we call metaplanning (planning without planning) has evolved in response to this impasse. The early sections of the paper deal with the implementation of new industrial policies which are the core of metaplanning, demonstrating how these policies simultaneously enhance systemic capacities for coordination while reassuring the public that the traditional American aversion to strong government is being upheld. The implication of metaplanning for industrial crises are examined in a final section. We argue that metaplanning facilitates private investment in profit rather than safety, early commercialization of new technologies which shifts risks onto the public, and distorts democratic processes and goals in the public management of industrial hazards.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/26162753,Industrial Crisis Quarterly,10.2307_26162753,Management & Organizational Behavior,1988.0,0,0.0034905653446912766,0,0.0012036625994369388,0,5.035240974393673e-05
