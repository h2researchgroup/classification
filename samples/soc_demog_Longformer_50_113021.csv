,,,Human Work in Catholic Social Thought,"In Catholic Social Thought, work is at the center of issues related to morality and economic life. It is simultaneously objective and subjective. Workers are the real agents of production, and therefore labor should have priority over capital. The able-bodied have a moral obligation to work to obtain the things they need, but everyone has a claim on the basic necessities of life. Hence the property claims of the well-to-do are not to exclude the poor from what they need. The property-right claim of stockholders depends on the firm serving work and the interests of workers. In unions, workers' natural right to form associations aligns with the right to participate in decisions affecting their lives.

A.H.M. Jones, A. Bernardi, C.M. Cipolla, and others have challenged this argument and have offered an alternative which focuses on the economic limitations of an agrarian based empire. The problem was manifest in an exceedingly oppressive system of taxation which also prevented system reproduction.

Both personally and professionally these men resemble each other as marginal people in relation to their families and to their academic contemporaries.

The liberal panacea is legal and juridical: citizens are 'equal before the law' regardless of their ethnic belonging. Marxism endorses this project of legal equality but argues that, as long as ethnic power is divided unequally outside the sphere of the law, it contributes to the reproduction of inequality.

There was, in addition, a message-only condition. Relative to the message-only condition, message set increased attitude change and communication-favorable thoughts, and decreased number of counterarguments and recall. Relative to the message-set and message-only conditions, task set decreased attitude change, recall and effort attending to the communication. On the basis of these results it was argued that different mediational models are operating for message-set distraction and task-set distraction. Specifically, it was proposed that message set produces a causal chain running from an increase in communication-favorable thoughts to a decrease in counterarguments to an increase in attitude change. On the other hand, it was proposed that task set decreases attitude change partially through a consistency-achieving devaluation of the interfering communication, and partially through a large decrement in recall.

This article provides a multidimensional, longitudinal description of the productivity of male and female biochemists. Several findings have implications for explaining differences in productivity. Sex differences in the numbers of publications and citations increase during the first decade of the career but are reversed later in the career. The lower productivity of females results from their overrepresentation among nonpublishers and their underrepresentation among the extremely productive. Among biochemists who publish, differences cannot be explained by patterns of collaboration, which are nearly identical for males and females, with one exception: females are much more likely to collaborate with a spouse. The smaller number of citations received by females results from their fewer publications, not from the quality of their publications. Papers by females on average receive more citations than those by males.

This study of Abraham Lincoln during World War II extends a semiotic interpretation of culture as it focuses on ""memory as a social frame.""

One-third of all Americans living in 1940 were born during the late nineteenth century, when Civil War resentments were fading and remembrances of Lincoln were more positive and vivid than ever. This generation understood the meaning of World War II by ""keying"" it to the Civil War. Patterned arrays of images of Lincoln were invoked by local and federal agencies to clarify the purpose of World War II, legitimate the preparations for it, and then to orient, inspire, and console the people who fought it. As a model for the present and of the present, images of Lincoln comprised a cultural system that rationalized the experience of war.

People supposedly are least depressed if they claim responsibility for good outcomes and deny responsibility for bad ones. Control theory states that active, effective problem solving builds well-being; thus a sense of personal control and responsibility for both success and failure is associated with low levels of depression. Which theory is right? Regression analyses of the self-reports of 809 randomly selected Illinois residents show that a sense of responsibility for both successes and failures (instrumentalism) is associated with low levels of depression. There is no measurable benefit from claiming responsibility for the good things while denying responsibility for the bad (self-defense). Depression is associated with not feeling in control of good outcomes, or of bad outcomes, or of both. The sense of control reflects the reality of social and economic status. It explains part of the relationship between status and depression.

,,,Development of Sex Differences in Economic Activity and Mental Health in Scandinavia,"In this preliminary study, sex differences in first admissions to mental hospitals in Finland, Norway, and Sweden are examined against the background of changes in the economic activity of men and women in 1939-1976. Hypotheses derived from earlier studies about the beneficial effect of meaningful economic activity on the mental health of women get some support from macro-level inter-country and historical comparisons. Also, women's growing awareness of their problems, expressed through the feminist movement, has helped them to solve their mental difficulties outside hospitals. Men seem to be more vulnerable than women to crisis situations like war and rapid structural change in society. During such crisis periods the sex ratio in mental hospital first admissions declines to the disadvantage of men. Before definite conclusions of the direct relationships between social changes and the mental health of the sexes can be made, studies at an individual level are needed. Ecological correlations between female/male ratios in mental hospital residency and the economic development of an area are positive. This is mainly due to the low hospital residency rates of men in the developed areas, where both sexes share the economic provider roles. Paid work among women seemingly does not threaten the mental health of men.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/4194268,Acta Sociologica,10.2307_4194268,Sociology,1979.0,0,4.287051524443086e-06,0,0.0002543871814850718,1,0.9992876648902893

However, hypotheses concerning the relationship between family compliance structures and school compliance structures, parental attachment, association with delinquent friends, and self-reported delinquent behavior are generally supported. Few differences are observed in separate analyses for males and females. Although the results raise questions about Colvin and Pauly's emphasis on a reconceptualized construct of social class, their incorporation of family and school compliance structures in their causal model is a promising contribution to the development of integrated theories of delinquency.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2781104,American Journal of Sociology,10.2307_2781104,Sociology,1990.0,0,0.0018895817920565605,0,0.0072217402048408985,1,0.9504157304763794
,,,"Social Learning, Reinforcement and Crime: Evidence from Three European Cities","This study reports a cross-cultural test of Social Learning Theory using direct measures of social learning constructs and focusing on the causal structure implied by the theory. Overall, the results strongly confirm the main thrust of the theory. Prior criminal reinforcement and current crime-favorable definitions are highly related in all three contexts and both strongly predict self-projections of criminal behavior. In addition, effects of prior reinforcement on projected misconduct appear to be both direct and indirect (through crime-favorable definitions). Yet, the findings also indicate that the processes underlying direct effects of reinforcement on criminal probabilities may need to be explicated further. Moreover, some types of definitions may be more influential than other types. Finally, parts of the reinforcement process may be affected by socio-cultural contexts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41682681,Social Forces,10.2307_41682681,Sociology,2012.0,0,0.00014847615966573358,0,0.005003677681088448,0,0.007938121445477009

They may be classified on the basis of the intensity of each code and the patterns that link the codes in each institution. Six types of boarding schools are delineated in this article. The ideal, hybrid type maximizes the pedagogical potential because it is based on the fusion of codes and the institutionalization of conflict among them. Consequently, it provides students with a high degree of freedom and the opportunity to experiment with various kinds of roles and rules and fosters the emergence of a commitment to universal values and responsible elite orientations.

,,,Anti-Busing Protest: Attitudes and Actions,"This study examines the influence of two social psychological perspectives-efficacy-trust and relative deprivation-on individual participation in anti-busing protest in a survey of South Boston residents. Previous works relating attitudes to the protest participation decision do not recognize that different types of protest are available and therefore fail to clearly discern the effect that particular attitudes have on specific protest activities. Findings include: (1) that support exists for identifying three separate types of protest: individual instrumental protest, individual expressive protest, and collective protest; (2) that the political efficacy-trust perspective best predicts individual instrumental protest; (3) that relative race deprivation best predicts individual expressive protest; and (4) that relative status deprivation best predicts engaging in collective protest. These results support viewing the two attitudinal perspectives tested here as complementary rather than competitive in explaining protest participation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3033913,Social Psychology Quarterly,10.2307_3033913,Sociology,1982.0,0,2.5044113499461673e-05,0,0.0002725329250097275,0,0.07916191965341568
,,,SECURING THE FUTURE: 'SURVIVAL STRATEGIES' AMONGST SOMERSET DAIRY FARMERS,"This paper examines the way in which farmers use survival strategies to ensure the reproduction of the family farm. These survival strategies develop from farmers' individual motivations and their attitudes towards social processes - the way they read history. However, farmers are constrained by their structural relationships. I argue that what is important is the way farmers understand their structural relationships and the meaning they give to them. This is so especially in the case of family farming, where there is an intersection between family-centred motivations and vocation-centred motivations. Initially I explore these issues by introducing the theoretical literature which attempts to understand the structural relationships in which farmers live and act. Then I describe farmers' family-centred and vocationalcentred motivations (or privatisms) and the way in which they understand social processes. These form the foundation for farmers' survival philosophy and practice.I conclude by arguing that farmers are (unintentionally) reproducing the structural relationships that are threatening the survival of the family farm in its present form.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42857621,Sociology,10.2307_42857621,Sociology,1991.0,0,0.000141406650072895,0,0.0003263921826146543,0,0.018368201330304146

,,,Poverty and Child Emotional and Behavioral Problems: Racial/Ethnic Differences in Processes and Effects,"Using a sample of four to nine year-old children from the 1992 wave of the Children of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data set, we evaluated racial and ethnic differences in the effects of current poverty and the persistence of poverty on child emotional and behavioral problems, and in the variables responsible for those effects. We considered three sets of variables in the latter analysis-mother's early characteristics and behaviors; correlated sociodemographic characteristics; and mediators (neighborhood problems, mother's psychological resources, and characteristics of the home environment)-and evaluated their relevance across three racial/ethnic subgroups (blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites). Consistent with our expectations, we observed a significantly stronger effect of the persistence of poverty on child problems for whites than for blacks, an effect that is attributable to the relatively strong association between poverty and mother's prior history of delinquency and current marital status among whites. The effect of poverty on child problems was substantially explained for blacks by mother's early self-esteem, whereas mediating processes took on greater relevance for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites. Our results support the conclusion that there are racial/ethnic differences in the selection processes and proximal conditions that are responsible for the diminished psychological well-being of poor children.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2676302,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_2676302,Sociology,2000.0,0,9.545500688545872e-06,0,0.0002542938163969666,1,0.9989044666290283

Using ratings-scale information from time-diary studies, this article examines the hypothesis that people who describe themselves as happier engage in certain activities more than those who describe themselves as less happy. Based on 34 years of data collected by the General Social Survey (GSS) on social activities and media usage, it is found that people who are happy report being more active in most social activities, in religion and in newspaper reading. On the other hand, happier people report less time watching television, a relation that holds after control for education, marital status and other predictors of happiness.

The well-educated tend to occupy professional jobs with more income and pressures, and experience more workfamily role blurring activities. These conditions contribute to greater conflict among the well-educated. In addition, people with less than a high school degree report more conflict because of their experience in precarious work with variable shifts. Finally, work-family conflict is associated with distress-but less so among those with the highest and lowest education.

,,,Individual-Adjustment Behavior versus Group-Welfare Behavior: Towards a New Conceptual Framework for the Study of Free-Riding: Theory and the Results of an Experimental Study,"The abundance of experimental literature on real subjects' behavior in social dilemma situations with free-rider options displays a discouraging instability of results. Particularly disquieting is the divergence of results depending on whether the social dilemma is modelled as a cooperation game with a Pareto-deficient solution or as a market transaction over some public good. We argue that this divergence of experimental data unveils a serious shortcoming of the theoretical framework of the study of free-riding up to the time being. Rather than taking free-riding as a straight indicator of an unwillingness to cooperate at all, it is proposed to operationalize non-cooperativeness as 'Individual-Adjustment behavior' and cooperativeness as 'Group-Welfare behavior'. Precise definitions in terms of welfare microeconomics are given for these two pure types of rational behavior in social dilemma situations. The point is that free-riding can occur in both types, even though under quite different conditions. Neglect of this fact may account for the confusion in the experimental data. The results of an experiment which confirm the usefulness of the proposed new conceptual framework are presented.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/522419,European Sociological Review,10.2307_522419,Sociology,1987.0,0,1.4245872080209665e-05,0,0.00020905942074023187,0,0.0005317313480190933

Illness level was the best predictor of hospital utilization in all three strata although sex was also a significant predictor among the young adults.
