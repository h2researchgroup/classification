0,,,,"Storytelling As Oppositional Culture: Race, Class, and Gender in the Borderlands","Bonnie Mitchell and Joe Feagin, influenced by the work of Robert Blauner (1972) and Michael Hechter (1975,1978), build on the theory of oppositional culture, arguing that African Americans, American Indians, and Mexican Americans draw on their own cultural resources to resist domination under internal colonialism. Patricia Hill Collins (1991) expands the politics of domination to include interlocking systems of race, class, and gender oppression among others and also discusses cultures of resistance to oppression. One of the cultural resources these theorists stress is storytelling. This paper suggests that Gloria Anzaldúa's prose and poetry is a conscious form of oppositional culture, in that Anzaldúa's storytelling serves as a social critique of domination as well as a cultural tool for empowerment of oppressed groups. A brief analysis of Anzaldúa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza is provided.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41674894,"Race, Gender & Class",10.2307_41674894,Sociology,1999.0,1,0.9998366832733154,0,0.0002567230840213597,0,0.01792990230023861,0.997531533241272,1

2,,,,Global-market building as state building: China's entry into the WTO and market reforms of China's tobacco industry,"This article analyzes how China's increasing engagement in the global market induced significant institution-building in China's tobacco industry and enabled a power shift from the local authorities to the central authority in controlling this market. During this process of ""getting onto the international track,"" the central government reorganized the industrial tobacco system and broke up the ""monopolies"" set up by local governments in order to enhance the competitive capacities of China's tobacco industry in the global market. Given such a concrete institutional change in China's tobacco industry, I propose the theory of ""global-market building as state building"" to explain the interactions among the global market, the nation-states, and the domestic marketbuilding projects. I suggest that nation-states strategically seek to engage themselves in the global market and that, under certain circumstances by taking advantage of their global market engagement, the nation-states can enhance their abilities to govern the domestic market.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40587515,Theory and Society,10.2307_40587515,Sociology,2009.0,1,0.9999163150787354,0,0.0005759710329584777,0,3.758236198336817e-05,0.9999926090240479,1

5,,,,Brothers and Breadwinners: Legislating Living Wages in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,"Attention to the implicit and explicit wage theories articulated by economic actors and embedded in public policy reveals the underlying social norms and values in specific historical and industrial contexts. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), the first federal minimum wage legislation in the United States, legitimated and institutionalized the idea that living standards and workers' needs matter in setting wages. They matter not simply in generating labor supply, but as the basis for government intervention in market mechanisms. Rather than viewing market mechanisms and government regulations dichotomously, economic actors debating the FLSA treated both market mechanisms and socially defined living standards as legitimate elements of wage-setting. Wage regulations also, by necessity, must grapple with issues of identity, that is, which workers (especially as defined by class, gender, and race-ethnicity) are deserving of particular living standards. Debates over the language in the FLSA reveal the contested nature of masculinity during the period of economic crisis in the 1930s. Advocates responded by defining a multiplicity of living wages corresponding with different living standards, as well as a multiplicity of strategies for achieving them.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/29770250,Review of Social Economy,10.2307_29770250,Sociology,2004.0,1,0.9576497673988342,0,0.0003605302481446415,0,0.32319095730781555,0.8586689829826355,1
6,,,,GEMEINSCHAFT AND GESELLSCHAFT IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"Large complex organizations incorporate into their framework many fields of specialization. These specialities tend to integrate, formulate common policies, regulate life conditions and uphold standards of excellence often in opposition to the large — complex organizations which require their services. In small, less complex organizations, there tends to be a closer identification with the organization and less with the speciality. The research problem was to test the validity of this theory of role complementation and conflict as related to academic organizations, the professors of smaller institutions of higher learning (colleges) were hypothesized to have a different composition of attitudes with regard to their institutions and professions than the professors of larger institutions of higher learning (universities). Samples were drawn of professors in the social sciences in contrasting institutional settings: a large university and four small colleges, all located in a large city in the midwestern United States. A questionnaire was drawn up to test six hypotheses concerning institutional and professional orientations which were theorized to differ as between the two sample groups. For five of the six hypotheses the findings were statistically significant by X² test at the .05 level. Such characteristics as age, rank, length of stay in a particular, institution, etc., of the two groups study failed to show any positive or negative relationship to professionalism. The differences between the sample groups, in short, were found to be due to institutional location. Neither the college nor the university professors were found to be exclusively professionally or institutionally oriented but responsive to both. However, differences in size, complexity, and milieu sometimes constrained one of these demands to be met at the expense of the other. Of the seven variables used to assess professional vs. institutional orientation — demands of professionalization, emphasis on teaching versus research, loyalty, conflict, publication, involvement, and independence, the findings revealed that social scientists in universities had a significantly higher professional orientation on six of these variables than those in the colleges.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41420476,International Review of Modern Sociology,10.2307_41420476,Sociology,1973.0,1,0.997710108757019,0,0.0015109832165762782,0,0.13835972547531128,0.959470808506012,1

8,,,,On Norms: A Typology with Discussion,"There is a lack of consensus in the literature, spanning multiple fields, on what exactly a norm is and furthermore on the characteristics differentiating types of norms. This paper provides definitions and a simple typology of norms with a focus on useful, objective distinctions. It is hoped that such a typology will add to the scientific rigor of communication, modeling, and clarity of thought on norms within economics and possibly other disciplines. The viability of ""more complete"" typologies, which often suffer from a lack of clear criteria for differentiating types of norms, is questioned. Two main properties of a norm are emphasized: (1) whether or not the behavior is simply what is done or whether it is what one should do, and (2) the source of sanctions for violating a norm, whether oneself, others, both or neither.",external-fulltext-any,American Journal of Economics and Sociology,10.2307_41329193,Sociology,,1,0.9781479835510254,1,0.9996607303619385,0,0.0013237560633569956,0.9958922863006592,1

10,,,,Who’s to Blame? The Identity Talk of Welfare-to-Work Program Managers,"U.S. welfare policy and devolution involve contradictions in implementing financial assistance as welfare workers must attempt to place clients with severe barriers in formal employment while meeting restrictive requirements. In interviews with North Carolina welfare-to-work program managers, the authors find that they engage in identity talk to construct images of themselves as effective workers despite these contradictions, using the symbolic identities of the “middle-class achiever” and the “thwarted advocate.” Location in rural counties with fewer resources leads to more polarizing strategies. The authors propose that service providers who face conflicting information and excessive frustration tend toward extremes, such as blaming clients or policymakers for program failures. This analysis contributes to the social psychological literature on inequality by demonstrating that reconciling contradictions as a service provider often entails certain strategic characterizations of clientele, both positive and negative.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/sop.2012.55.3.501,Sociological Perspectives,10.1525_sop.2012.55.3.501,Sociology,2012.0,1,0.8458986878395081,0,0.006245368625968695,0,0.11688201874494553,0.9999728202819824,1
11,,,,A Minor Office: The Variable and Socially Constructed Character of Death Certification in a Scottish City,"Those doctors in a Scottish city who had completed the most death certificates in 1985 were identified, interviewed about their certifying practices, and asked, for comparative purposes, to complete a series of dummy death certificates, based on case summaries. Analysis of the dummy certificates indicated substantial inter-practitioner variations in practice. From the interview data it is clear that the completion of death certificates is a very minor office: for most certifying doctors, death certification is an unsupervised, unreported, invisible, and unconsidered activity. It is argued that doctors who write large numbers of certificates conduct their certifications in Schutz's ""world of routine activities"" (Schutz 1970). It is this routinized orientation to certification that allows the practitioner to dwell within the ""habitus"" (Bourdieu 1977) of the medical collectivity but outside a normative order. Death certification may stand as an exemplar of a large number of medical activities, where wide and largely unacknowledged variations in practice occur with each practitioner investing his or her own practices with moral worth.

12,,,,Beyond the Tipping Point:,"This article explores the influence of personal values and ontological beliefs on people’s perceptions of possible abrupt changes in the Earth’s climate system and on their climate change mitigation preferences. The authors focus on four key areas of risk perception: concern about abrupt climate change as distinct to climate change in general, the likelihood of abrupt climate changes, fears of abrupt climate changes, and preferences in how to mitigate abrupt climate changes. Using cultural theory as an interpretative framework, a multimethodological approach was adopted in exploring these areas: 287 respondents at the University of East Anglia (UK) completed a three-part quantitative questionnaire, with 15 returning to participate in qualitative focus groups to discuss the issues raised in more depth. Supporting the predictions of cultural theory, egalitarians’ values and beliefs were consistently associated with heightened perceptions of the risks posed by abrupt climate change. Yet many believed abrupt climate change to be capricious, irrespective of their psychometrically attributed worldviews or “ways of life.” Mitigation preferences—across all ways of life—were consistent with the “hegemonic myth” dominating climate policy, with many advocating conventional regulatory or market-based approaches. Moreover, a strong fatalistic narrative emerged from within abrupt climate change discourses, with frequent referrals to helplessness, societal collapse, and catastrophe.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24907371,"Weather, Climate, and Society",10.2307_24907371,Sociology,2011.0,1,0.9974341988563538,0,0.11716962605714798,0,0.0024765487760305405,0.9999973773956299,1
13,,,,To Be or Not to Be? Some Comments On The Professional Identity of Applied Sociologists in Non-Academic and Academic Settings,"The current paper discusses a challenge faced by both beginning and more-established applied sociologists: how to maintain a sociological identity when working in applied settings. Using information culled from informal interviews of applied sociologists practicing in both academic and non-academic settings, we outline some questions that demand further investigation. What challenges do sociologists in applied settings experience as they strive to maintain their sociological identity? What mechanisms do they employ to develop, maintain, and enhance their sociological identities? Do applied sociologists experience conflicting loyalties in terms of professional organization memberships, research interests, publishing patterns, and similar issues? With the current concern about an ""identity crisis"" in the discipline, we contend that it is important to begin addressing how this identity crisis could be tied to individual experiences.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43481405,Journal of Applied Sociology,10.2307_43481405,Sociology,1998.0,1,0.7189435362815857,0,0.00022857902513351291,0,0.025277752429246902,0.9999958276748657,1
14,,,,ON THE DEMISE OF OLIGARCHIC PARLIAMENTARISM IN THE SEMI-PERIPHERY: A BALKAN-LATIN AMERICAN COMPARISON,"This paper focuses on peripheral capitalist societies which (a) acquired their political independence relatively early and had already in the 19th century adopted parliamentary forms of political representation; (b) experienced a considerable degree of capitalist industrialization during the inter-war and post-war periods. A fundamental dimension for understanding the structure and functioning of political institutions in the above societies has to do, not only with the mode of expansion and structure of industrial capitalism but also with its timing: with the fact that in all these formations the transition from oligarchic to broader forms of political representation precedes rather than follows their industrialization. Three distinct forms of transition are identified: urban populism from above (the Latin American Southern Cone pattern), peasant populism from below (the pattern in interwar Northern Balkan societies) and political inclusion through a transformation of clientelistic networks (the Greek pattern).",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42853191,Sociology,10.2307_42853191,Sociology,1983.0,1,0.9692395925521851,0,0.0021351247560232878,0,0.0006186014506965876,0.9513998031616211,1
15,,,,Gender and Ethnicity at Work: Occupational Segregation and Disadvantage in the 1991 British Census,"This article uses detailed occupational data from the 1991 Census to investigate patterns of occupational segregation for women and men in the different ethnic groups. Gini index values suggest that the Black minority ethnic groups identified in the Census were less gender segregated than White people. There was less ethnic variation in women's employment than in men's. Chinese and Bangladeshi men were heavily concentrated within catering occupations. The association between women's part-time work, gender segregation and occupational disadvantage does not hold for all ethnic groups. Some minority ethnic groups were occupationally advantaged relative to White people and, among Bangladeshi people, women were more occupationaliy advantaged than men. The data suggest that gender and ethnicity do not combine to create double disadvantage for minority women in the labour force; patterns of occupational advantage and disadvantage are more complex. However; lack of detail on 'women's jobs' and the invisibility of hierarchies within occupational groups mean that some inequality is obscured.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42856571,Sociology,10.2307_42856571,Sociology,2003.0,0,1.1258865924901329e-05,0,0.0002502850547898561,1,0.9999725818634033,0.7747787237167358,1

Three interactionist concepts inform this study. The concept of scene directs our attention to the comprehensive social worlds driven by Latino music. The concept of idioculture directs our attention to the ways audience members experience Latino music within everyday life small groups.

Lieberson and Carter's study of the ethnic composition of eminent Americans, using Who's Who in America, is replicated with data from the 1990s (Lieberson and Carter, 1979, American Sociological Review 44:347-366). In addition, comparisons between blacks listed in Who's Who in America and blacks listed only in Who's Who among Black Americans are made. During the 20 years since Lieberson and Carter's study, Jews have made remarkable gains in eminent membership, while the rate of black representation has increased only moderately.

21,,,,River Forecast Application for Water Management:,"Managing water resources generally and managing reservoir operations specifically have been touted as opportunities for applying forecasts to improve decision making. Previous studies have shown that the application of forecasts into water management is not pervasive. This study uses a scenario-based approach to explore whether and how people implement forecast information into reservoir operations decisions in a workshop setting. Although it was found that participants do utilize both forecast and observed information, they generally do not utilize probabilistic forecast information in a manner to appropriately minimize risks associated with the tail end of the forecast distribution. This study found strong tendencies for participants to wait for observed information, as opposed to forecast information, before making decisions. In addition, study participants tended to make decisions based on median forecast values instead of considering forecast probability. These findings support the development of quantitative decision support systems to optimally utilize probabilistic forecasts as well as for forecast agencies such as NOAA/NWS to continue investments in work to better understand contexts and environments where forecasts are used or have the potential for use in supporting water management decisions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24907523,"Weather, Climate, and Society",10.2307_24907523,Sociology,2013.0,0,1.9626548237283714e-05,0,0.0016327867051586509,0,0.0017345119267702103,0.9999332427978516,1

27,,,,Governmental Policy and Equality in Higher Education: The Junior Collegization of the French University," This article examines the implementation of the ideology of equality of educational opportunity in governmental policy by examining the 1976 French higher education reform. It argues that the reform was designed to suppress growing class conflict in the higher education system. It further argues that France, like the United States, has a dual system of higher education and that class dominance of this system has been assured by governmental policy using the ideology of equality of opportunity to legitimate that dominance. The 1976 reform represents an attempt by the government to preserve the dual system of higher education and to preserve class dominance of that system. This attempt is accomplished by junior collegizing and devaluing the French University, and thus reserving the elite institutions with entrée to the highest occupations to the highest social class.

28,,,,The Impact of Military Service on Authoritarian Attitudes: Evidence from West Germany,"A study by Campbell and McCormack in 1957 of the U.S. Army was replicated 10 years later in the West German Army. Age and education were controlled, and the possibility of a panel effect was checked, and the earlier finding that militaryexperience reduces authoritarianism of draftees was confirmed. This study also investigated the permanence of the observed effect. The effect was a very temporary response to the specific military-life situation. An interpretation is offered that the experienced deprivation increases the sensitivity of coldiers to those items in the scale indicating respect and tolerance for fellow citizens.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776504,American Journal of Sociology,10.2307_2776504,Sociology,1972.0,1,0.9888420104980469,0,0.0001300047879340127,0,0.005790841765701771,0.9999823570251465,1
29,,,,Magic in the Social Construction of the Past: the Case of Teschen Silesia,"The aim of the paper is to consider such ethnolinguistic categories as magic, connotation, cognitive blending as possible keys to the following questions: How is it possible that we can perfectly adopt different representations of the past and internalize them as our past? How can we reconcile different representations of the past and how is it possible that diverse representations of the past merge in one social memory? Such amalgamations of various forms of representations and diverse scales of objectification can be clarified by means of the theory of magic, by means of the law of resemblance, and the law of contiguity. Such considerations are supported here by empirical study of the construction of social memories in Teschen Silesia, which was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1920. On both sides of the new border different state institutions emerged and influenced local memories.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41969500,Polish Sociological Review,10.2307_41969500,Sociology,2013.0,1,0.9435511231422424,0,0.0076956069096922874,0,0.001311553525738418,0.9879943132400513,1
30,,,,Relational Troubles and Semiofficial Suspicion: Educators and the Medicalization of “Unruly” Children,"Using an interview-based analysis of the accounts of interactions between educators, parents, and clinicians, this study explores educators' roles in interpreting childhood troubles as the medical phenomenon of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The analysis of interviews shows how children's “personal” troubles become understood as “relational” ones, prompting increasingly sophisticated social responses. I argue that the institution of education, operating in a clinical capacity but lacking the legitimate authority to assign ADHD diagnoses, plays a hybridized, semiofficial role in the medicalization process. This assertion informs a critique of the “informal/official” dichotomy found in the sociology of deviance lexicon, and furthers previous positions in the sociology of mental health that have implicated school representatives in the social construction of behavior disorders.

31,,,,Institutional Arrangements and Stratification Processes in Industrial Societies,"This chapter reviews the current state of our knowledge about the role of institutional arrangements in stratification processes in industrial societies. The particular institutional arrangements considered are those of educational and labor force organizations. The review is organized around the Blau-Duncan basic model of status attainment and points to the need for a more elaborated conceptualization. Institutional arrangements structure the connections between social origin and educational attainment, between educational attainment and early labor force placements, and between early and later placements in the labor force. Industrial societies vary widely in the nature of these institutional arrangements, and that variation affects the patterns of movement from origins to destinations in the stratification system. Features of educational institutions considered include separation of students into specialized schools and ability groups (tracking), degree of central control, degree of autonomy, degree of stratification, and the number and specialized nature of credentials. Features of labor force institutions considered include occupational and firm-specific job classifications, internal labor markets and vacancy chains, industrial sectors and career lines. Critical aspects of the societal variation are the form of the interface between education and labor force structures and the nature of the transition from school to work. A preliminary set of hypotheses linking institutional arrangements and stratification processes is derived from this review.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2083414,Annual Review of Sociology,10.2307_2083414,Sociology,1995.0,1,0.9997380375862122,0,0.0009625169914215803,1,0.9950329065322876,0.9999994039535522,1
32,,,,Social Constructionist and Positivist Approaches to the Sociology of Emotions,"Social constructionist and positivist approaches to the sociology of emotions differ in three respects: (1) social constructionists generally reject the importance of the biological and physiological substrate in the determination of specific emotions, while positivists affirm the opposite view; (2) social constructionists suppose that emotions are largely determined by social norms for emotion, or ""feeling rules,"" while positivists assert that social structure, particularly the outcomes of actors' power and status relations, determines emotions; and (3) social constructionists, following a symbolic interactionist model, propose that actors must define situations before emotions will be experienced-but they do not explain how this is done, or what categories actors use to help them define situations; positivists on the other hand ofter a specific social structural category scheme for defining situations and determining the emotions those definitions produce. These issues are discussed and suggestions for reconciling the two views are proposed.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2778461,American Journal of Sociology,10.2307_2778461,Sociology,1981.0,1,0.9235137701034546,1,0.9998892545700073,0,0.0006313156918622553,0.9999939203262329,1
33,,,,Beyond the Industrial Paradigm: Market-Embedded Labor and the Gender Organization of Global Service Work in China,"Despite the international growth of the service sector, an industrial paradigm defines the study of global labor. This is because analyses of service work typically focus on firms in the United States, while studies of global labor concentrate on manufacturing. I develop a framework for analysis of global service work by comparing ethnographic cases of labor in two global, luxury hotels in China. Each hotel is linked to the same U.S.-based global corporation, and both employ the same organizational template and recruit same-aged female workers. At the first hotel, workers silently cater to the preferences of guests, using recorded customer preference data and enacting imported feminized practices, a labor regime I call virtual personalism. At the second hotel, workers promote hotel products, displaying expertise to distinguish themselves from sex workers who frequent the hotel, a labor regime I call virtuous professionalism. Why do distinctly gendered labor practices emerge in the two settings? To explain the divergent regimes of labor, I show that firms institutionalize localized consumer status struggles through the gendered organization of interactive labor. Workers' interactive strategies and local workplace legacies mediate the forms institutionalism takes. I call the entwining of consumer markets and labor practices ""market-embedded labor.""",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25472512,American Sociological Review,10.2307_25472512,Sociology,2008.0,1,0.9999333620071411,0,0.00023342654458247125,1,0.9996439218521118,0.9999375343322754,1
34,,,,INDUSTRIAL PATERNALIST CAPITALISM AND LOCAL LABOUR MARKETS,This paper is an attempt to identify those structural conditions which are conducive to the rise and maintenance of industrial paternalist capitalism within Britain. Following Newby's discussion of the nature of deference industrial paternalism is defined as the specific form taken in Britain by economic and political structures in which the unequal distribution of resources is legitimated by tradition. A key factor in the maintenance of such systems of traditional authority is the nature of the owners of local productive capacity. Two features are emphasized; the extent to which local assets constitute the bulk of all capital owned by the local bourgeoisie and the existence of historical links between such owners of local capital and the area. Empirical measures of the nature of local labour markets are used to identify those areas of the country which contain the structural features most likely to support industrial paternalism. It is suggested that such areas can be characterized as relatively isolated local labour markets which are dominated by single companies.,https://www.jstor.org/stable/42852029,Sociology,10.2307_42852029,Sociology,1978.0,1,0.9025031328201294,0,0.001712366589345038,0,0.45114758610725403,0.9895380735397339,1

36,,,,'Project heat' and sensory politics in redeveloping Chicago public housing,"This article examines Chicago's ongoing public housing reforms and more broadly, welfare reform, as a kind of sensory politics. I analyze experiences of home heating at a redeveloping public housing project to establish how neoliberal demands for self-responsibility have become tied to demands that transitioning residents reconfigure their subjective senses of comfort. These twin demands have distributed the risks of transitioning out of public housing across an individual's understanding of personal security as well as her obligations to kin. I show how approaching welfare reform as a sensory politics illuminates the emerging conditions of political recognition available to Chicago public housing residents as their longstanding representational bodies face obsolescence. Moreover, I argue that this approach invites us to reconsider theories of contestation and survival within urban poor people's social movements.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24048083,Ethnography,10.2307_24048083,Sociology,2011.0,1,0.9925088286399841,0,0.0004176315269432962,0,0.0004875038575846702,0.9998519420623779,1

It draws on the concepts and methods of Anselm Strauss, especially social worlds/arenas theory, to analyze the negotiations and conflicts through which both scientific knowledge and public health policy were created. Science/policy interactions were shaped by shifting distributions of power and legitimacy among many interested social worlds. These shifts reflected changing cultural, commercial, and political conditions which, over the decades, favored the entrenchment of initially provisional and tentative dietary recommendations. The cultural foundations of policy interventions can be as salient as scientific research. They can also contribute to ongoing instability in controversial arenas.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/si.1998.21.4.401,Symbolic Interaction,10.1525_si.1998.21.4.401,Sociology,1998.0,1,0.891526460647583,0,0.00030246778624132276,0,0.0004500881477724761,0.9998371601104736,1

It is widely believed that the typical volunteer is middle-aged and middle-class and that volunteerism is rooted in American cultural individualism. Undocumented and unexplored are collectivistic roots of giving, which may have a different social base than individualistc-grounded volunteerism.

40,,,,The Emergent European Model in Skill Formation: Comparing Higher Education and Vocational Training in the Bologna and Copenhagen Processes,"Proposing an alternative to the American model, intergovernmental reform initiatives in Europe have developed and promote a comprehensive European model of skill formation. What ideals, standards, and governance are proposed in this new pan-European model? This model responds to heightened global competition among ""knowledge societies"" as it challenges national systems to improve. The authors thus compare this emergent European model with the historically influential models of Germany, France, Great Britain, and the United States. To what extent does the European model resemble these traditionally influential national models? The authors report findings of a theory-guided content analysis of official European policy documents in higher education and vocational training from 1998 to 2010. They find that while the European model is a bricolage that integrates diverse characteristics of influential models, the ambitious goals and standards codified in the twin Bologna and Copenhagen processes in higher education and vocational training offer a new model to compete internationally. Dozens of countries now seek to implement these principles. This comparative analysis finds different visions for the future of skill formation on both sides of the Atlantic.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41507161,Sociology of Education,10.2307_41507161,Sociology,2012.0,0,9.007658081827685e-05,0,0.0003196402976755053,0,0.00017953944916371256,0.9999929666519165,1
41,,,,Theory and Method in Status Attainment Research,"This paper analyzes a contradiction between theory and method in status attainment research. The authors argue that the Meadian social psychology adopted by the status attainment researchers is incompatible with causal modeling which they use as their principal analytic tool, because Mead's ideas are inconsistent with any method which assumes unidirectional causality. A symbolic interactionist interpretation of the process of status attainment is offered in place of the causal interpretation. The symbolic interactionist interpretation removes the contradiction between theory and method and is, in addition, shown to be compatible with current sociological knowledge of the process of education. Finally, it is argued that the symbolic interactionist interpretation is also compatible with American political language, while the causal interpretation is not, and that therefore the adoption of the symbolic interactionist interpretation would permit the findings of status attainment research to speak to the question of the degree of equality of opportunity in American society as that question is asked in American politics.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/si.1981.4.1.59,Symbolic Interaction,10.1525_si.1981.4.1.59,Sociology,1981.0,0,0.008938204497098923,0,0.0002630476374179125,0,0.000705606013070792,0.9999985694885254,1
42,,,,Determinants of the Social Environments of Sheltered Care Settings,"A conceptual framework is used to examine the relation of the social environments of sheltered care settings to the type of setting and three other sets of environmental domains: physical and architectural features, organizational policies and programs, and aggregate resident and staff characteristics. The framework is illustrated with data from 90 sheltered care facilities. The relative importance of each set of variables as predictors of seven dimensions of the social environment is estimated using multiple regression and partitioning of the explained variance. The results show that: (a) variables from all four sets are related to the social environment, (b) architectural and policy features have the strongest unique effects on social environments, and (c) a substantial portion of the explained variance is shared among combinations of two or more sets of predictors.

45,,,,Negating the Democratic Party Advantage in Open Seat Elections—A Research Update,"Objective. In an earlier paper in this journal the author argued that Republican prospects for electoral success in the House of Representatives rested on fielding politically experienced candidates, negating Democratic party advantages in spending, and taking advantage of the opportunities created in the South due to affirmative action redistricting. Methods. This study examines the role of open seats in forging the Republican majority in 1994. The 1994 open seat congressional elections are examined at the district level to determine how Republican open seat performance improved, compared to the previous decade, and how GOP improvement related to Republican gains. Results. GOP success in open seats occurred under conditions similar to those indicated by previous research, with one significant exception: the South. This analysis indicates that the Democratic party advantage was negated by a strong backlash vote against professional Democratic politicians in that region, and by changes in district demographics during the previous redistricting. Conclusions. The new Republican majority rested in part on the change in GOP fortunes in open seats, especially in the South. Redistricting, changing white voter allegiances, and a change in the relationship between candidate experience and voter expectations were also related to GOP success.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/44072659,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_44072659,Sociology,1995.0,0,2.385304651397746e-05,0,0.4712347984313965,1,0.8121388554573059,0.8818376064300537,1

This paper attempts to go beyond previous research studies by exploring the usage of the Internet by sex, education, income, and age within the racial categories of white and non-white.

This paper examines how living in a single parent family affects intergenerational marriage patterns regarding preferred family size. Data collected from 1300 college students at a large midwestern university provide further evidence of a positive relationship between number of siblings in one's family of origin and preferred marital family size. However, this relationship does not hold for all groups. Factors affecting preferred family size differ for males and females from intact and nonintact family structures.

48,,,,Disaffiliation from a New Religious Movement: The Importance of Self and Others in Exit,"Challenging the popular belief that people who join new religious movements (NRMs) become “entrapped,” this study describes the way in which 23 former members of 11 different “cults” personally negotiated disaffiliation. The current findings support previous studies that posit exit as a resolution to unresolved doubts and dissonances, and contribute to this literature by suggesting that the nature of these dissonances, and the way in which exit constitutes a “solution” to these dissonances may vary. It is suggested that for approximately half of the participants in this study, the dissonances that precipitated exit, were relatively minor, primarily caused by organizational changes and inconsistencies in the teachings. While generally doubts were resolved privately and commitment sustained, exit occurred when alternate discourses or other identity resources became available through which doubts could become resolved. The remaining participants describe the conflicts that precipitated disaffiliation as pertaining to tensions between the groups' expectation of conformity and their sense of autonomy. These participants describe exit as a solution to the stress and emotional exhaustion of membership. To make sense of these different disaffiliation narratives, symbolic interactionist notions of the self as constructed in both the realm of “Self” and “Others” are applied.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/symbinte.36.3.314,Symbolic Interaction,10.2307_symbinte.36.3.314,Sociology,2013.0,0,0.0010073286248371005,0,0.0001671451609581709,0,0.012195810675621033,0.9999935626983643,1
