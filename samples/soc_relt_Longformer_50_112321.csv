,,,Colonialism and Development: A Comparative Analysis of Spanish and British Colonies,"Recent research shows that colonialism reversed levels of development in much of the non‐European world. To explain this reversal, analysts focus on conditions within the colonized areas. By contrast, drawing on evidence from Spanish and British colonialism, the authors show that the economic models of the colonizing nations also affected the reversals of fortune. Mercantilist Spain tended to colonize most extensively precolonial regions that were populous and highly developed; in turn, extensive Spanish colonization had negative consequences for postcolonial development. In comparison, liberal Britain tended to colonize most extensively precolonial regions that were sparsely populated and underdeveloped; in turn, extensive British colonialism had comparatively positive effects. Thus, both Spain and Britain reversed the fortunes of precolonial regions, but in largely opposite ways.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/499510,American Journal of Sociology,10.1086_499510,Sociology,2006.0,0,1.819838144001551e-05,1,0.9201639890670776,1,0.7093670964241028

,,,ROLL OF EXTENDED FAMILY NETWORKS IN THE INDUSTRIALIZATION PROCESS: THE CASE OF IRAN,"A number of unresolved issues remain when studying social change and the family. Past research, which has concluded that industrialization affects change in family structure, has been tested mainly in western cultures. Recent research in non-western societies has indicated that the extended family may also affect the industrialization process. This paper attempts to treat the latter question and test the hypothesis that ties with the extended family will influence a person's decision as to whether or not he should remain working in newly established industry in regional centers in order to bring about general regional economic and social development. Data were collected from 191 persons with a bachelor of arts or science degree or more, who were employed in four semi-public industries in two regional cities of Iran and 96 of their spouses. An ex post facto design was utilized to test the hypothesis. Indices used were an index of social ties consisting of four types of contact: (1) receiving help in looking after our children or looking after other's children, (2) discussing problems, both receiving and giving advice, (3) receiving or giving financial help in terms of money and goods, (4) visiting for talking, relaxation or performing leisure time activities with others, and an index of perceived problems concerning social ties. Frequency of contact and deviance in the number of types of contact before and after migration were also used. Social contact with extended family members did not seem to be related to the employee's attitude toward leaving his regional work environment. Whether persons increased or decreased their extended family contacts after migration was not significant related to the decision to remain in their new work environment for a shorter or longer period. Extended family ties did not seem to have an effect on decisions to live at some distance from other relatives. Therefore, in this study extended family could not be considered a deterrent to the industrialization process. Other variables were operating which has a push-pull effect on persons to man new industry. In general migrants were less likely to want to stay for any length of time than non-migrants irrespective of family contact. A number of other important variables were discovered and further analysis will clarify the major impetus for remaining a part of the newly industrializing region.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23027038,International Journal of Sociology of the Family,10.2307_23027038,Sociology,1975.0,0,0.00020734347344841808,1,0.9999090433120728,0,0.1678122878074646

On the basis of studies comparing judgments from European, Japanese, and American samples of convenience, nearly universal agreement about the relative size of life event ratings has been claimed. In the present research, an expanded list of 102 life events was rated by a systematic New York City sample stratified by social class, ethnicity, and sex. Mean ratings supplied by the 92 New York City judges correlated highly with those previously published from the West Coast American, Japanese, and Western European samples. These correlations, however, decreased monotonically with New York social class. Further analyses show that these results can be explained both by true differences in ratings and by errors in the rating task that are related to the class and ethnic backgrounds of the New York City judges. The findings indicate that cultural differences in judgments about the magnitude of life events are greater than previous reports based largely on samples of convenience have suggested.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2955350,Journal of Health and Social Behavior,10.2307_2955350,Sociology,1977.0,0,0.00025858095614239573,1,0.999482274055481,1,0.9919905066490173

,,,Measuring State TANF Policy Variations and Change After Reform,"Our objectives are to describe the policies adopted after PRWORA, which vary across states, to test for common underlying policy concepts, demonstrating how these policies are interrelated, and to examine whether policy stringency diffused to neighboring states results in greater policy stringency across all states over time. We convert textual TANF welfare guidelines into empirically derived policy dimensions and use the derived quantitative scores to describe variation and change in welfare policy dimensions across status during the 1996-2003 post-welfare-reform period. Methods. Utilizing the Urban Institute's Welfare Rules Database, we apply a factor analytic methodology to 78 unique state policy guidelines that were coded on a lenient-to-stringent continuum. Regression analyses, employing spatial contiguity weighting, are used to describe policy diffusion. Results. The results identified 15 underlying first-order post-welfare-reform policy dimensions, which for scientific parsimony were further reduced to three secondorder underlying dimensions representing rules governing eligibility: eligibility requirements for groups, behavioral responsibilities for maintaining eligibility, and eligibility time limits and exemptions. Analysis of the quantitative scores showed that by 2003 states had become more lenient regarding eligibility criteria for groups but decidedly more stringent regarding behavioral guidelines for maintaining eligibility and eligibility time limits and exemptions. Spatial clustering is not found globally but is significant for some states at the local level. Spatial diffusion is apparent only for behavioral rules. Conclusions.

Linear regression with random effects is employed in two statistical models. Results. Even when the black district population and party are considered, the presence of an African-American legislator leads to greater substantive representation of black constituents. Conclusion.

,,,SOME PROBLEMS OF AIM-CENTRED MODELS OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS,"Social movements are commonly regarded either as irrational responses to social tension or as rational attempts to introduce social innovations. In the latter case, the aims of the movement are necessarily the main focus of attention. But the example of the Christian Socialist movement illustrates the fact that the aims of social movements are flexible and that specific aims may emerge only after the formation of the movement itself; thus to focus on the aims of the movement as the cause of its existence is inappropriate. It is however not necessary to conclude from this that the expressed aims of a movement are merely justifications of irrational actions; aims are caused, and partly by the activities of the movement, but they are also causal. What is needed is a dialectical model of the process of social movements representing the interaction of ideology and action and not implying the necessary priority of either, involving an image of man as both acted upon and acting. The case of the Christian Socialist movement provides the basis for the construction of such a model.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42851845,Sociology,10.2307_42851845,Sociology,1977.0,1,0.8948280215263367,0,0.0005139449494890869,0,0.0004525776603259146

It does so by exploring the possible relationships between sociology and the existential issues thrown up by Asian philosophical and religious traditions, and in particular Buddhism, and the in many ways parallel arguments of Deep Ecology. In doing so it calls into question the adequacy of current sociology as a vehicle for addressing fundamental existential questions and in particular the issues of social suffering, the emerging ecological crisis and the alternative conceptions of society generated by many of the new social movements, and suggests ways in which this inadequacy might potentially be resolved.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23655202,Asian Journal of Social Science,10.2307_23655202,Sociology,2009.0,0,0.058911897242069244,0,0.00015552194963674992,0,0.0003296048962511122

As such the present Attitudinal scale was developed with the aim of measuring the attitude toward all relevant dimensions of inter-caste marriage in the Indian context.

After scrutiny by 48 experts it was modified to contain only 83 statements covering attitude towards six dimensions of inter-caste marriage. This scale was standardized on 200 students drawn randomly from nine departments of postgraduate studies. Likert method of item analysis using two extreme groups representing 25 percent of the subjects at each extreme of the attitude continuum was adopted for standardization. Fifty items with high 't' values were thus selected. The resultant scale was further statistically analysed for three correlations, viz, (i) correlation between the item and the dimension which it measured (item-total correlation), (ii) inter item correlations within each dimension, and (iii) inter dimensional correlations. In this process four items were deleted. Split-half realibility was found to be 0.9614.

To prevent unearned income (economic rent) from adding to the economy's cost of living and doing business, potentially rent-yielding infrastructure should be kept in the public domain as a ""fourth factor of production.""

,,,Transformation of the Finnish employee ideal in job advertisements from 1944 to 2009,"In this article we examine transformation of the Finnish employee ideal since the Second World War. Our qualitative analysis is based on the data of 490 job advertisements from 1944 to 2009, and follows the change in employee requirements during this period. Our results show that requirements for transferable, particularly interpersonal, skills increased considerably during the research period. While workmanship, diligence, competence and work experience were the most common employee requirements in the job advertisements of the 1940s and 1950s, employees today are required to possess qualities such as stress resilience, flexibility, productivity, inventiveness and the desire to learn new things. The qualities required of white-collar employees have increased in particular. We conclude that, unlike the post-war period, today the ideal employee is characterized by flexibility and interpersonal skills reflecting changes in the organization of work, work organizations and work culture.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24708245,Acta Sociologica,10.2307_24708245,Sociology,2013.0,1,0.8942731618881226,0,0.008328520692884922,0,0.017495838925242424

,,,State Building as a Source of Islamic Political Organization,"Previous research on political Islam in the Middle East and North Africa has been limited in providing a generalizable theory of its origins and systematically account for the cross-national variation in the prevalence of Islamic movements. Following a state-centered approach, this study argues that state-building activities are a primary origin of Islamic movements. Regimes adopt religious symbolism and functions that legitimate the role of Islam in the public sphere. State incorporation of religion thus creates Islam as a frame for political action, with increased access to mobilizing resources and better able to withstand repression and political exclusion. To provide an explicit and systematic test of cross-national variation, data on 170 political and militant organizations across the region are analyzed. Results indicate that state incorporation of religion is a crucial factor in the religiosity of movement organizations. Mixed effects of political exclusion and repression are found. No support is found for theories of economic grievances or foreign influence as causes of Islamic mobilization. In sum, analysis suggests that a state-centered perspective is the most fitting account of political Islam.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40210404,Sociological Forum,10.2307_40210404,Sociology,2009.0,1,0.6316205859184265,0,0.0001491763541707769,0,0.00026378402253612876

An additional aim of this paper is to show the relevance and significance of these attempts and to examine the extent to which early Ford research can inform our applied research today. In particular, this study examines the early data collection efforts by investigators of the Ford Motor Company Sociological Department. These took place in the early part of 1914 and aimed at gathering information concerning workers' habits, family situations, financial states, home conditions, and social and economic behavior. These investigations were thorough and exhaustive. The outcome of Ford's research resulted in the classification of all company workers into four main categories used to decide who would or would not qualify for the Ford profit sharing plan. An equally important part of the mission of Ford's investigators was to guide the workers to modify their behavior to secure the profit sharing portion of the salary. This was an example of the paternal capitalistic ideology that characterized Ford Motor Company labor relations during this period.

Firewalking and serpent handling exemplify such rituals. I argue that these two radical ritual practices, which I term spiritual edgework, provide a valuable sociological window on how radical ritual practices are socially constructed.

However, little systematic or representative research supports the claim that women, in essence, exchange sex for men's participation in housework. Although research and theory support the expectation that egalitarian marriages are higher quality, other studies underscore the ongoing importance of traditional gender behavior and gender display in marriage. Using data from Wave II of the National Survey of Families and Households, this study investigates the links between men's participation in core (traditionally female) and non-core (traditionally male) household tasks and sexual frequency.

When informants felt they had enough information, they told us which of their acquaintances was most likely to know the target person, or, more precisely, could serve as the first step in a chain of acquaintances. The data show that four basic questions (location, occupation, age, and sex) account for more than 50 percent of questions asked, and a basic collection of six or seven questions would suffice for most circumstances. Less often used questions tend to be employed only when the basic set produces no useful information for that informant.

,,,Measuring Public Sector Size in the Advanced Market Economy Countries: The Problem of Deflators,"A great deal of scholarly attention has been directed to understanding the causes of the growth of the public sector in the developed market economy countries in recent decades. Unfortunately, this literature has been clouded by uncertainty over measurement of the central variable at issue, the relative size of the public sector. Traditionally, public sector size has been measured as the ratio of government expenditures to GDP, with both figures expressed in current national currencies. Recently, however, this standard approach has been criticized by those who argue that figures for government expenditures and GDP should be separately deflated to account for different rates of inflation in the public sector and the economy as a whole. The purpose of this paper is to explore the empirical relationship between same- and different-deflator indicators of public sector size, focusing on social expenditures in 19 developed market economy countries over the period 1960-1981. The analysis finds that same- and different-deflator indicators are generally strongly correlated and that the choice of deflators, while of some importance, is not of overriding significance in assessing four major explanations of public sector growth in the countries examined.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27520967,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_27520967,Sociology,1992.0,0,1.4757026292500086e-05,1,0.9999361038208008,0,0.001118714571930468

This model is empirically tested by a cross-cultural comparison which includes five groups of families: (i) West German families; (ii) Turkish migrant families of the second generation which were constituted after migration to West Germany; (iii) Turkish migrant families of the first generation, for which marriage took place before migration; (iv) Turkish re-immigrant families, which returned after a stay in West Germany to Turkey; (v) Turkish families. In the mother tongue interview with fathers or mothers a specific 'target child' was chosen, whose age, sex and birth place is known. The parent was asked about his/her educational aims and attitudes and early child care and socialization practices in relation to this child. Empirical results are presented to show similarities and differences for the subpopulations under consideration.

,,,"Language, Audience, and the Transformation of Disputes","This article develops an analytic framework for comparing dispute processing within a single institution and across different cultures, by focusing on the transformation of disputes. Case studies from diverse nonwestern and western settings are examined to show how disputes change as they are processed in response to the interests of various participants. Disputants, supporters, third parties, and relevant publics seek to rephrase and thus transform a dispute by imposing established categories for classifying events and relationships (narrowing), or by developing a framework which challenges established categories (expansion). Disputes may be expanded by adding new issues, by enlarging the arena of discussion, or by increasing the number and type of active participants.

To ascertain how images of parents and images of self predict God images, 132 young adults aged 18-22 (M = 19) completed the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, and a six-item measure of God's perceived involvement in their lives (religiosity scale). In a follow-up interview, they rated their parents, God, and selves on scales of closeness, nurturing, power, and punishing/judging. For men, mothers were responsible, more than fathers, for creating a climate for sons' self-esteem through nurturance and discipline, which in turn contributed to seeing God as nurturing, feeling close to God, and being more religious. For women, mothers and fathers created a model of nurturance and power, which contributed to seeing God as nurturing and powerful. Punishing/judging parents directly affected punishing/judging God images in these young adults.

Relying on existing conceptualizations of track formation and assignment, it argues that certain aspects of tracking are primarily a response to organizational constraints within a school and are not governed solely by students' learning needs. Analyses of longitudinal data on 1,669 students in several middle schools reveal that the number; stability; and, to some extent, the size of tracks are determined independently of characteristics of the student population distribution. Students' assignments to tracks are strongly influenced by their track history, as well as by prior achievement, and there is a modest independent influence of select background characteristics.

This article conducts a comparative analysis of temporal and generational patterns in Mexican-American female headship compared to patterns for non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. These patterns are explored within two frameworks of assimilation, the more general assimilation perspective and the ""segmented"" assimilation perspective. Methods. Logistic regression analysis looking at female headship is conducted using die 1960-1990 IPUMS. Additional analyses use the 1995 CPS to look at intergenerational patterns of female headship, divorce, and nonmarital fertility among Mexican-origin women relative to other groups of women. Results. Analysis using the IPUMS finds that U.S.-born Mexican-origin women have higher levels of female headship in every year compared to white women, and this difference has actually increased over time. Additionally, analysis using the 1995 CPS finds that while levels of female headship for second-generation Mexican-origin women are no higher, levels for thirdgeneration Mexican-origin women far surpass those of white women. The high levels of female headship and the proportion of never married women with children in the household among third-generation Mexican-American women are starding and lend more support to a ""segmented"" assimilation framework.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42955929,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42955929,Sociology,2004.0,0,4.375598291517235e-05,0,0.0003262649697717279,1,0.9996416568756104

The main line of analysis demonstrates how different psychiatric ideologies produce different objects of professional focus and, consequently, radically different forms of therapy and therapeutic environment. By way of empirical evidence, the paper examines in some detail three contrasting contexts in which psychiatric disorder has been described and organised. The first is represented in Freud and Breuer's Studies on Hysteria, the second in the case books of a turn of the century asylum, and the third in the activities and practices of a modern psychiatric ward. By drawing on these sources of data, it is argued that an understanding of large scale changes in the organisation of psychiatric health care (such as is evident, for example, in modern trends from hospital to community care), firmly depends upon a study of the inner structure of psychiatric ideologies. Furthermore, and as a corollary of this it is claimed that appeals to extra-psychiatric (economic) interests and/or scientific (pharmacological) advances as key factors for explaining processes or organisational change (especially the process of deinstitutionalisation), are essentially misleading.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42857658,Sociology,10.2307_42857658,Sociology,1991.0,1,0.9992675185203552,0,0.00058014813112095,0,0.0010439055040478706

It is argued that economic rationalism which produces mainstream technology and structure may prevent the maximisation of QOL because of their negative effects on health and the quality of relationships.

It goes on to examine the population factor with special reference to densities and annual average growth rates. Far from being connected with population growth as such, it is shown that underdevelopment and poverty in most West African countries is to a greater extent a function of poor education and training as well as agricultural stagnation. Partly resulting from the absence of improvements in agricultural techniques and partly due to what has virtually become an exodus from rural to urban areas, agriculture has stagnated, even declined, to the extent of impeding economic development.Apart from education and agriculture, another factor considered to be basic in perpetuating under development in economic dependence of countries in the West African subregion. The paper concludes with the view that West African under development reaches far beyond the issue of population growth. As such, it considers the link which population alarmists posit between population control through Family Planning and rapid economic development, at least with respect to West Africa, a misplaced one.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41420544,International Review of Modern Sociology,10.2307_41420544,Sociology,1975.0,0,3.0753479222767055e-05,0,0.05695503577589989,1,0.860575258731842

Organized around the phenomenology of 'growing older together' (Schutz, 1976), the films invite emotional identification as they go about exploring unique, shared, and fluctuating experiences of the self. The documentaries resonate with the work of ethnographers who revisit the field, who seek to craft coherent narratives from a surplus of material, and who confront ethical problems as they investigate the private lives of subjects. The Seven Up! linear narrative of social class determination loosened in subsequent films as contingency, variation, and the dynamics of gender, generation, and parenting came more fully into view.

,,,Aids and Gay Men: Individual Strategies and Collective Coping: A Follow-Up Study of Gay Men in the Federal Republic of Germany,"This paper summarizes the results of two surveys assessing the changes in the sexual behaviour of homosexual men under the impact of AIDS in West Germany and West Berlin. The risk of possible infection is increasingly taken into account by gay men in the Federal Republic. Regular use of condoms has already gained widespread acceptance-considering the short time available to become familiar with such usage. Attitudes to the risk of infection are chiefly determined by the impact of AIDS in the immediate social environment, by the extent of social integration in a network of supportive groups and by the degree to which the homosexuality of gay men is accepted by their social environment. In spite of the high level of information about AIDS that most gay men have at their disposal, and the widespread adoption of low-risk sexual practices, it remains apparent that certain subgroups are still not being adequately reached. 'Closeted' homosexuals, homosexuals with low educational and professional status and bisexual men are substantially less well informed than self-identifying gay men with higher educational and professioanl status. Concepts that better appeal to and better inform these groups are urgently required. The demographic group 'males with homosexual behaviour' can only be reached to a limited degree by targeting it as a homogeneous group.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/522490,European Sociological Review,10.2307_522490,Sociology,1990.0,0,4.28286730311811e-05,0,0.0003436855913605541,1,0.6744168996810913
,,,"Determinants of Morbidity and Disability Trends in the United States, 1958-77","Macrodynamic structural-equation models are presented that show how changes in annual levels of aggregate indexes of several morbidity and disability conditions for the United States over the years 1958 to 1977 affect each other and are affected by other aggregate demographic and socioeconomic changes. After reviewing the record of annual changes in these indexes based on data from the National Health Interview Survey, patterns of temporal covariation in the time series are discussed and some tentative structural-equation models are constructed to account for their behavior. Statistically, the analyses reveal considerable variation in levels of year-to-year variance explained for these indexes - from 35 percent explained for days of school loss to 97 percent for all acute conditions. Substantive findings imply that a decreasing proportion of preschool children in the population contributes to a decline in the incidence of infective and parasitic diseases, and an increasing proportion of the population at the older ages results in increases in the prevalence of chronic conditions, days of bed disability, and days of restricted activity. Further, increases in economic prosperity lead to an increase in the incidence of injuries and a decrease in the incidence of viral conditions, while higher levels of unemployment produce more injuries and restricted activity days. These inferences corroborate, for the most part, results of prior studies that have been restricted to cross-sectional analyses. In addition, however, they provide a basis for making explicit quantitative projections of future levels of morbidity and disability in the American population on the basis of exogenous demographic and socioeconomic conditions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27520979,Social Indicators Research,10.2307_27520979,Sociology,1981.0,0,1.6410771422670223e-05,0,0.00018165246001444757,1,0.9811958074569702
,,,The Stranger Transformed: Conceptualzing On and Offline Stranger Disclousure,"Disclosures, secrets, and stranger associations have long intrigued social researchers. In this article I consider the transformation of stranger associations with the use of mediated communication. I consider how non-mediated and mediated forms of stranger associations vary based on characteristics such as synchronicity, distance, ease of break, permanency of break, and stranger shopping. In addition, I propose the concept of ""strange making technologies""—those that create for acquaintances and intimates that particular tension between remoteness and distance that Simmel identified as unique to the form of the stranger. Furthermore, I suggest that this strange making quality that is particularly strong in Internet communications has both the potential to deepen and dismantle already established relationships.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23250083,Social Thought & Research,10.2307_23250083,Sociology,2001.0,0,0.0003521425533108413,0,0.0002892838674597442,0,0.0028445743955671787
,,,"The English village, whiteness, coloniality and social class","This article explores the entwining of discourses of race, class and coloniality within a specific set of racialised discourses articulated by white middle-class and middle-aged residents of a suburban English village. I draw upon Fran ken berg's (1993) analysis of whiteness and the contemporary reproduction of colonial notions of cultural difference to examine whites' othering of wealthy British Asian (BrAsian) residents and the everyday construction of non-Western others. My contention is that central to the reproduction of the idea of the village as a white and English space is amnesia of the colonial past and its implications for the postcolonial present. I examine how this process of amnesia mediates an aspect of my co-conversationalists' representations of wealthy BrAsian residents as immigrants, that is, cultural others whose origins are thought to belong outside the village community, the nation and ultimately the West.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43572634,Ethnicities,10.2307_43572634,Sociology,2012.0,0,0.062327466905117035,1,0.9903951287269592,1,0.9288977384567261
,,,"Defining Appropriate Labor: Race, Gender, and Idealization of Black Women in Domestic Service","Appropriate labor conveys the notion of a negotiated ideal indicating who has been collectively defined as suited for a particular type of work. Importantly, these negotiations provide a justification for why a group is represented in one occupation as opposed to another. Using domestic service as an example of an occupation based in an informal, female-centered organizational structure we illustrate the process by which black women came to be seen as the idealized worker in Northern U.S. households between the mid-19th and -20th centuries. The analyses demonstrate that the designation of black women as appropriate labor enabled the maintenance of an institution that was vital to the social reproduction functions of white, middle-class, American households.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43497500,"Race, Gender & Class",10.2307_43497500,Sociology,2012.0,1,0.9999680519104004,0,0.0003719301603268832,1,0.9990447163581848
