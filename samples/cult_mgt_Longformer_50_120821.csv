0,,,,Analyzing Cross-National Management and Organizations: A Theoretical Framework,"The differential social control embedded in core and periphery values indigenous to a cultural setting, and the availability of resources in that setting, are discussed as critical factors for the effective adaptation of organizations and management practices transferred across cultural boundaries. The relationships between these factors and organizational structure, processes, and behavior, are analyzed and specified in a theoretical framework. The framework postulates the importance of congruent or, at least, accommodative relationships between the core values dominating the local setting, and those underlying transferred practices for the effectiveness of ""imported"" organizational practices. Four main contingencies of local-imported values' incongruence are described, and their implications for ""entry"" and ""coping"" strategies of cross-national organizations are discussed. The framework also offers a scheme for generating hypotheses regarding the effects of values on structures and behavior in cross-national organizations. The theoretical and managerial implications of the scheme are discussed and illustrated.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2632844,Management Science,10.2307_2632844,Management & Organizational Behavior,1994.0,1,0.9748116135597229,1,0.868808925151825,0,0.000692417670506984
1,,,,Television representations of food: A case study,"This paper describes the results of a semiotic analysis of one popular television food programme: 'Rick Stein's Taste of the Sea'. The analysis suggests that this programme produces a number of conventional meanings within which specific messages about food are embedded. These findings indicate that television food programmes offer the hospitality provider important insights into the contemporary cultural formation of the consumer and into the ways by which key product concepts can be marketed, which can be of benefit to the hospitality industry. In addition, the categorisation of concepts and discourses upon which food programmes draw for their meanings offers a methodological and conceptual framework for future research of the genre.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42919209,International Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_42919209,Management & Organizational Behavior,1999.0,1,0.9563668370246887,0,0.00505705364048481,0,9.099447925109416e-05
2,,,,Arbiter of science: Institutionalization and status effects in FDA drug review 1990-2004,"In this article the author proposes that firm status has a significant effect on the regulatory evaluation process. Regulators rely on external signals of quality such as status to resolve uncertainty, and the tendency to be infused with 'value beyond the technical requirements of the task at hand' (Selznick, 1957) causes status positions in institutionalized domains to be particularly salient. Using review times for 839 New Drug Applications approved by the Food and Drug Administration between 1990 and 2004, the author finds that firms with higher status in the scientific knowledge domain receive faster approval for their drugs. The effect of status strengthened when products address underserved disease areas, and when following a major product withdrawal in the industry. Status in areas unrelated to the therapy category had a stronger effect on approval speed than therapy-specific status, implying that status effects are driven by values in addition to technical concerns.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43581858,Strategic Organization,10.2307_43581858,Management & Organizational Behavior,2012.0,1,0.9999837875366211,1,0.9652894735336304,0,0.00016803026665002108

This article focuses on a form of this infrastructure: namely, the creation and diffusion of conversations and practices around corporate responsibility in a developing country. The article highlights the experience of the Ethos Institute in Brazil. Between 1998 and 2007, Ethos has successfully convened 1,250 member business organisations around conversations and forums on corporate responsibility.

6,,,,Chefs and occupational culture in a hotel chain: A grid-group analysis,"A fierce recession in the UK between 1991 and 1995 led the hotel group Forte, like most companies, to initiate urgent turnaround and survival policies. This paper reports on a study of chefs' behaviour within Forte Crest Hotels, London, the strain placed on their occupation during this recession and the aftermath of Forte's levered corporate change policies in 1994—95. The enquiry was carried out before the hostile take-over of Forte by Granada in January 1996. Using grid-group analysis, a qualitative study based on structured interviews was undertaken. These interviews were analysed for commonalities and differences within a grid-group analysis framework, which addresses organisational, individual and group behavioural phenomena in a given social context. The findings reveal behavioural insights into the occupational identity of chefs and the allegiance they give to their occupation when faced with a programme of radical change initiated by management.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23746718,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23746718,Management & Organizational Behavior,2001.0,1,0.9991713762283325,0,0.00022952837753109634,1,0.8172746896743774

The movement, generally known as the Anti-Amalgamation of Shrines Movement, was carried out by Minakata Kumagusu, an encyclopedic naturalist. The author translates several excerpts from Minakata's letter, which was addressed to a professor of botany, into English and explicates the opinions stated there in terms of the three ecologies: the ecology of biology, the ecology of society, and the ecology of mind.

12,,,,Democratization and Participative Research in Developing Local Theory,Interest in participative work research began to emerge in Norway almost a decade ago as part of the further development of the Norwegian Industrial Democracy Programme. Enactment of an innovative work environment law in 1977 based on workers actively participating in studying and changing their own workplace increased the need for participatory work research techniques. A primary prerequisite is the indigenous evolution of `local theory'. Three case studies illustrating the technique of `organizational mapping' to develop local theory are described.

The new Austrian school has challenged the methodological approach of neoclassical economics in many areas. This essay seeks to extend that challenge into the area of labor economics.

Efforts to green the economy require an understanding of corporations and public organizations as consumers as well as an understanding of individuals as consumers. The article sets out the arguments for treating all organizations as consumers and as a dominant but underemphasized force in greening the economy. It then considers organizational consumption in the context of supply chains, with respect to the issue of agency within the organization and with respect to the transmissions of market signals for innovation.

17,,,,The influence of temporary time offs from work on employer attractiveness – An experimental study,"By offering temporary time off programs, companies aim at increasing their employer attractiveness. However, little is known about whether temporary time off programs increase the attractiveness of employers and to what extent this effect is shaped by how temporary time off programs are designed. Using signaling theory, we propose that potential employees receive signals from temporary time off programs that influence the employer attractiveness and that this influence is moderated by risk aversion. Against this background, our article presents an experimental investigation of the influence of temporary time off programs on employer attractiveness. It was shown that only paid temporary time off programs have a positive effect on employer attractiveness, and that risk-averse individuals perceive companies that offer paid temporary time off programs as more attractive. The results indicate that the design of temporary time off programs and the level to which potential employees are risk-averse have a general effect on employer attractiveness.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24570261,Management Revue,10.2307_24570261,Management & Organizational Behavior,2015.0,0,0.0002387255517533049,0,0.00033416037331335247,0,0.1601683646440506

20,,,,Impact of Growth Opportunities and Competition on Firm-Level Capability Development Trade-offs,"How should managers prioritize among production, product development, branding, internationalization, and other capabilities and resources? This question is central to the resource-based view, and the answer depends not only on the direct returns on investment in each capability but also on the trade-offs in using those returns for future growth or survival in a competitive market. Through simulation experiments, this study examines firm-level capability development trade-offs in the context of a firm's market-level competition and growth. It is found that investing in operational capabilities (which enhance short-term performance) gains priority over investing in long-term dynamic capabilities when the operational capability investment strengthens the reinforcing loop between performance, investment flow, and capability development.Such operational capability investment provides growth opportunities and competitive advantage. Moreover, in strategic competition, firms anticipating rivals' focus on short-term growth need to further ignore dynamic (long-term) capability building in order to survive. Testable propositions are offered as to how trade-offs between short-term and long-term investments depend on different firm and industry characteristics. The results may explain why short-term-focused firm behavior persists in firms even in the absence of discounting, short-term managerial incentives, decision biases, or learning failures.",external-fulltext-any,Organization Science,10.2307_41429022,Management & Organizational Behavior,,0,7.169695891207084e-06,0,0.0003771822666749358,0,0.00021349513554014266
21,,,,Bigger and Safer: The Diffusion of Competitive Advantage,"Research on the diffusion of technologies that give competitive advantage is needed to understand the role of technology in competition. Predictions on which firms first obtain useful technologies are made by cluster theory, which holds that the diffusion is geographically bounded, and network theory, which holds that adoption is more rapid in central network positions. These predictions can be evaluated using data on the diffusion of supplier innovations that give competitive advantage to firms in the buyer industry. Here, the diffusion of new ship types is studied using the heterogeneous diffusion model and data on shipping firm- shipbuilder networks, showing that valuable innovations remain rare because they are not adopted by distant firms in geographical and network space. The strong influence of geographically dispersed interfirm networks on technology diffusion justifies a greater role of interorganizational networks in the theory of competitive advantage.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40060244,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_40060244,Management & Organizational Behavior,2009.0,0,5.6195312936324626e-05,0,0.0009369105682708323,1,0.7864751219749451

Limitations of western management and behavioral science approaches are noted, and an hacienda model is suggested as a cultural context for understanding the means by which information processing occurs. Bureaucratic constraints, integrating mechanisms, and the critical role of informal information channels are argued to be central dimensions of a comprehensive analysis of organizational functioning in Latin America. A critique of traditional data-gathering methodologies is made in light of Latin values, norms, and political realities, and implications are discussed regarding alternative schemes for obtaining more valid organizational information.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40227518,Management International Review,10.2307_40227518,Management & Organizational Behavior,1980.0,1,0.9916423559188843,0,0.00032503277179785073,0,0.0003889219951815903
31,,,,"Taking off: Category contrast and organizational mortality in the UK airline industry, 1919-64","This study analyzes the role of Category contrast in the context of an emerging industry. The level of contrast, the degree to which a category stands out from its background, appears to be an important aspect of the legitimation process, but as of yet poorly understood. The article explores three potential roles: as providing legitimacy to the category as such, as allowing for legitimacy spillovers to peripheral members, and as strengthening density-dependent legitimation. The study investigates these potential roles using longitudinal data on organizational naming patterns in the early passenger airline industry in the United Kingdom.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43581891,Strategic Organization,10.2307_43581891,Management & Organizational Behavior,2013.0,1,0.9999653100967407,1,0.9633453488349915,1,0.8433064818382263
32,,,,The Relationship between Citizen Involvement in the Budget Process and City Structure and Culture,"This study examines the use of citizen participation in the budget process in council-manager cities. Citizen involvement was expected to vary based on city election methods, population, racial diversity, and political culture. The study used an International City/County Management Association survey that asked city managers about their use of seven different citizen participation methods in the budget process. The most often used methods involve officials sharing information about the budget rather than citizen input. Use of these methods did not vary significantly among cities with different election methods, but differences were found based on size and political culture. The results have implications for the development of effective participation mechanisms.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3380726,Public Productivity & Management Review,10.2307_3380726,Management & Organizational Behavior,2000.0,1,0.8997910618782043,0,0.00016505048552062362,0,3.9024635043460876e-05

Using a framework that roughly classifies initiatives into state/government, market/economic, and civil society categories, the paper illustrates the rapid evolution of new infrastructure that is pressuring companies to be more responsible.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27747465,Academy of Management Perspectives,10.2307_27747465,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,1,0.9999903440475464,0,0.003640233539044857,0,0.00016450670955237
35,,,,Jumping Ship: The Diffusion of Strategy Abandonment,"This paper focuses on organizations' abandonment of strategy, which may be driven jointly by contagion and competition from other organizations. This paper treats both explanations but emphasizes contagion. I argue that strategy abandonment is contagious because the future performance of current and alternative strategies is highly uncertain, causing decision makers to examine the actions of other organizations in the industry for clues to the correct action. Contagion from organizations easily observed by the focal organization is stronger than contagion from other organizations, causing corporate links across markets to become important routes for the contagion of strategy abandonment. This theory is tested on a sample of radio stations abandoning a strategy and is supported by evidence that contagion of abandonment occurs through the influence of an organization's social reference groups.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2393793,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2393793,Management & Organizational Behavior,1995.0,1,0.9997591376304626,0,0.1276843249797821,1,0.9729586243629456
36,,,,CSR with Chinese Characteristics: An Examination of the Meaning of Corporate Social Responsibility in China,"This paper explores the meaning of corporate social responsibility (CSR) informed by the unique socio-historical contexts of China. The paper analyzed reports of 20 China-based companies published in 2012 using a grounded theory approach. Analysis of the 1473-page data reveals that the Chinese organizations mobilize CSR in search of a new ground of legitimacy during the transition from planned to market economy. However, although economic efficiency is highlighted, with the embracing of social harmony, relational responsibilities, and hierarchical social structure, this notion of CSR resembles inheritance of a redecorated socialist past rather than conversion to liberal-democratic ideals. This research contributes to the development of a global CSR framework by questioning the neoliberal ideals as the taken-for-granted foundation of corporate social responsibilities. It also has practical implications for multinational corporations interested in exploring the Chinese market.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.61.71,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.61.71,Management & Organizational Behavior,2016.0,1,0.9911298751831055,0,0.000674705021083355,0,7.80512418714352e-05

38,,,,An Assessment of the Scientific Merits of Action Research,"This article describes the deficiencies of positivist science for generating knowledge for use in solving problems that members of organizations face. Action research is introduced as a method for correcting these deficiencies. When action research is tested against the criteria of positivist science, action research is found not to meet its critical tests. The appropriateness of positivist science is questioned as a basis for judging the scientific merits of action research. Action research can base its legitimacy as science in philosophical traditions that are different from those which legitimate positivist science.

39,,,,Participation with Supervisor and Subordinate Authoritarianism: A Path-Goal Theory Reconciliation,"This research sought to reconcile previous studies in which participation and job satisfaction of subordinates were sometimes effectively moderated by their authoritarianism and sometimes not. The degree of task repetitiveness was hypothesized to determine when the authoritarianism of subordinates moderated between their participation with their supervisors and job satisfaction. It was hypothesized that: (1) participation would be satisfying to low-authoritarian subordinates regardless of the degree of task repetitiveness but would be satisfying to high-authoritarian subordinates only on tasks with low repetitiveness. (2) Highly repetitive tasks would be less conducive to ego involvement than low-repetitive tasks. These relationships were tested by questionnaires returned from 353 employees of a manufacturing organization who represented all levels of the hierarchy. The results supported the research, reconciling conflicting results obtained in previous studies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2392048,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_2392048,Management & Organizational Behavior,1976.0,1,0.9245975017547607,0,0.008484974503517151,0,0.0018031150102615356
40,,,,Implicit Understandings in Channels of Distribution,"Formal agreements can be used to achieve coordination among channel members. These agreements work by exerting explicit control over the members who make the agreements. However, implicit understandings can be used as a partial substitute for more formal agreements. In this paper, we show that implicit understandings can develop as channel members learn about each other's behavior. We show that... -This learning leads to the use of the implicit influence each channel member has over the other's behavior. -The learning leading to an implicit understanding requires some form of experimentation or historical observation. -This learning results in an oscillating retail price. -When only one channel member learns the other's behavior, both channel members obtain greater profits than when neither member learns, and both channel members obtain less profits than when both members learn. However, the member who does not learn obtains more profits than the member who learns. We also show that... -Implicit understandings result in greater channel profits than in their absence. -Implicit understandings cannot fully substitute for an explicit contract. -Implicit understandings result in a retail price which is higher than the price resulting from an explicit contract but lower than the price resulting in the absence of an implicit understanding. -Implicit understandings develop as channel members learn each other's behavior. We demonstrate that the form of learning discussed in this paper is consistent with a somewhat general demand function. Finally, the paper provides some examples of both symmetrical learning, where both channel members learn at the same speed and asymmetrical learning where channel members learn at different speeds.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631458,Management Science,10.2307_2631458,Management & Organizational Behavior,1985.0,0,0.0001070588332368061,0,0.0006101912003941834,0,0.00014471466420218349
41,,,,"Complementarity, Status Similarity and Social Capital as Drivers of Alliance Formation","Using data on U.S. investment banking firms' syndication in underwriting corporate stock offerings during the 1980s, this study explores the factors that drive alliance formation between two specific firms. We compare resource complementarity, status similarity, and social capital as a basis of alliance formation. The findings indicate that the likelihood of investment banks' alliance formation is positively related to the complementarity of their capabilities, as well as their status similarity. Social capital arising from banks' direct and indirect collaborative experiences also plays a very important role in alliance formation. The number of deals given by a lead bank to a potential partner over the past three years has an inverted U-shaped relationship to the probability that the lead bank will invite the potential partner to form an alliance. Our findings indicate that status similarity and social capital have a stronger effect on alliance formation in initial public offering deals than in secondary offering deals, as the former are more uncertain than the latter. Using these findings, we discuss the role of complementarity, status similarity, and social capital in alliance formation.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3094116,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_3094116,Management & Organizational Behavior,2000.0,0,1.2996092664252501e-05,0,0.00023375485034193844,0,4.586959767038934e-05
42,,,,Some Models for Estimating Technical and Scale Inefficiencies in Data Envelopment Analysis,"In management contexts, mathematical programming is usually used to evaluate a collection of possible alternative courses of action en route to selecting one which is best. In this capacity, mathematical programming serves as a planning aid to management. Data Envelopment Analysis reverses this role and employs mathematical programming to obtain ex post facto evaluations of the relative efficiency of management accomplishments, however they may have been planned or executed. Mathematical programming is thereby extended for use as a tool for control and evaluation of past accomplishments as well as a tool to aid in planning future activities. The CCR ratio form introduced by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes, as part of their Data Envelopment Analysis approach, comprehends both technical and scale inefficiencies via the optimal value of the ratio form, as obtained directly from the data without requiring a priori specification of weights and/or explicit delineation of assumed functional forms of relations between inputs and outputs. A separation into technical and scale efficiencies is accomplished by the methods developed in this paper without altering the latter conditions for use of DEA directly on observational data. Technical inefficiencies are identified with failures to achieve best possible output levels and/or usage of excessive amounts of inputs. Methods for identifying and correcting the magnitudes of these inefficiencies, as supplied in prior work, are illustrated. In the present paper, a new separate variable is introduced which makes it possible to determine whether operations were conducted in regions of increasing, constant or decreasing returns to scale (in multiple input and multiple output situations). The results are discussed and related not only to classical (single output) economics but also to more modern versions of economics which are identified with ""contestable market theories.""",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631725,Management Science,10.2307_2631725,Management & Organizational Behavior,1984.0,0,1.2990120012545958e-05,0,0.028797201812267303,0,2.4679657144588418e-05

44,,,,A Goal Programming Example in Public Health Resource Allocation,"A model developed to aid a state-level resource allocation process in the United States Department of Agriculture Special Supplement Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is presented. The model is formulated as a linear integer goal program, utilizing service levels for six categories of WIC participants as goals. The model employs a methodical, consistent approach to the allocation process, yet allows ample flexibility for consideration of state-specific issues. By allowing the user to adjust the relative importance of each goal, the model can incorporate subjective attitudes of state-level WIC administrators. This is extremely important as these attitudes are the result of the administrators' familiarity with the WIC program in their states, and the significance of input of this nature should not be neglected. An application of the model to the Indiana WIC program is presented. Sensitivity of the model to changes in the objective function weights and in the target values for the goals is explored. Although orginally developed to allocate budget increases, the model may be used in allocating budget cuts as well; this form of the model is also presented. The model can be extended hierarchically to incorporate resource allocation at the federal level. This modeling approach should be useful in all public sector programs characterized by multiple objective and hierarchical decisionmaking.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631803,Management Science,10.2307_2631803,Management & Organizational Behavior,1984.0,0,2.4872051653801464e-05,0,0.0005584033206105232,0,0.000295972335152328

Kadane and Larkey reject the use of these normative solution concepts. Yet, this amounts to throwing away an important piece of information to the effect that the players are rational and expect each other to be rational. Even in situations where the players do not expect each other to act with complete rationality, normative game theory can help them heuristically to formulate reasonable expectations about the other players' behavior.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631295,Management Science,10.2307_2631295,Management & Organizational Behavior,1982.0,0,0.005805845372378826,0,0.0007841300102882087,0,0.00027918937848880887

Livingston of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who since 1947 has collected forecasts for the upcoming 6 and 12 months. The results reveal that, in general, for the period from 1947 through 1978, the economists in Livingston's sample did not produce efficient forecasts and were not able to outperform simple statistical models. It should be noted, however, that a substantial and consistent improvement in forecasting performance by economists in Livingston's sample did occur over this same period.

48,,,,Why the Third Sector in Japan Did Not Succeed: A Critical View on Third Sectors as Service Providers,"Third sector projects were promoted by the Japanese central government as a perfect remedy for poor government performance. However, the third sector was not a savior of the situation; rather, it generated significant deficit. In this research, I redefine the concept of the third sector in Japan, which is different from that in the United States and England. I analyze the third sector corporations as service providers using profit-maximization theory and quasi-market theory. Also, I interpret the roles and activities of the third sector with the model of triangles and discuss the relation between the government and third sector firms, problems, and various implications to draw lessons from the Japanese third sector experience.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/20447624,Public Performance & Management Review,10.2307_20447624,Management & Organizational Behavior,2006.0,0,0.00011383827950339764,0,0.11500448733568192,0,0.0002267452364321798
49,,,,Firm-Specific Knowledge Resources and Competitive Advantage: The Roles of Economic- and Relationship-Based Employee Governance Mechanisms,"The resource-based view of the firm emphasizes the role of firm-specific resources, especially firm-specific knowledge resources, in helping a firm to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. However, the deployment of firm-specific knowledge often requires key employees to make specialized human capital investments that are not easily redeployable to other settings. Thus, in the absence of effective safeguards and trust building devices, employees with foresight may be reluctant to make such specialized investments. This study explores both economic- and relationship-based governance mechanisms that might mitigate this underinvestment problem. Effective use of these governance mechanisms enables a firm to obtain greater performance from its efforts to deploy firm-specific knowledge resources. Empirical results further support these key arguments.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27735491,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_27735491,Management & Organizational Behavior,2009.0,0,2.361933366046287e-05,0,0.00020333526481408626,0,3.458886931184679e-05
