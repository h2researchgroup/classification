,,,The Abortion Controversy: Conflicting Beliefs and Values in American Society,"This study examines the ideological and structural bases for attitudes and political action relating to abortion. Data on abortion attitudes from a random sample of ""Middletown"" in the fall of 1989 (N = 400) indicated that the strongest effects on abortion attitude stemmed from a belief that life begins at conception, a belief in privacy rights, and religion. Social traditionalism was also found to play an important role in a pro-life stand, but it was influential only for conservative Protestants and not for Catholics. A general commitment to avoid taking anyone's life was significantly related to abortion attitudes but only for Catholics. For political action, the data showed that the pro-life movement was still more important in 1989 than was the pro-choice movement. Party identification was not related to an expressed willingness to use abortion as a political litmus test, but attending pro-life churches did increase the likelihood that pro-life adherents would use abortion in making voting decisions.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1386830,Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion,10.2307_1386830,Sociology,1992.0,0,0.0006480896845459938,1,0.9998990297317505,0,0.0019049810944125056

Analyses showed that communication-based forms of involvement in implementation (communicating with systems personnel and trainers, communicating about new ways to use the system, and receiving support from supervisors for doing so) were overwhelmingly more important than either general participation or computer use in predicting increases in interdepartmental interaction. Changes in tasks and roles also led to new, informal, face-to-face contacts to support computer system use, as well as greater administrative control over the organization as a whole.

,,,"Max Weber, Parliamentarism and the Rhetorical Culture of Politics","In this article the concept of parliamentarism is extended to the concept of 'government by speaking' (Macaulay 1857), to a political form of rhetorical culture based on arguing for and against. Weber's relationship to parliamentarism is reassessed in this perspective. The first part deals with his 'parliamentary theory of knowledge', which refers to his view that the competition of perspectives is constitutive of the human sciences. In this sense the Weberian ideal of scientific practices resembles politics in its openness to change and re-valuation of controversy. In the second part Weber's critique of anti-parliamentarism is analysed as a rejection of political controversy and struggle. In the third part Weber's theory of knowledge serves as a point of departure for re-reading his late writings on suffrage, parliamentarism and politicians. The opposition between bureaucracy and politics in particular can be rendered more intelligible in terms of Weber's 'parliamentary theory of knowledge'.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24579692,Max Weber Studies,10.2307_24579692,Sociology,2004.0,1,0.9995884299278259,1,0.9861477017402649,0,4.1439827327849343e-05

Despite the character of relevant demographic data (i.e. the relatively low mean age at first marriage, low proportion of children born out of wedlock and high nuptality rate) we argue that in terms of their trends they provide us with indication that there are more and more women and men for whom the traditional pattern of family formation does not hold any longer, and that living together unmarried as an early form of family life-course or as an alternative to previous experience with marriage is something that can be found in Czechoslovakia. To support our hypothesis we conducted two surveys among partners applying for marriage licenses in 1985 and 1990. Results showed that 31 % and 37 % of couples contracting their first marriage lived together in 1985 and 1990, respectively. The proportion of cohabitants among couples contracting a second or third marriage was 73 % and 77 %. Our conclusion is that unmarried cohabitation in Czechoslovakia does exist.

,,,"""Happier than Non-Christians"": Collective Emotions and Symbolic Boundaries among Evangelical Christians","This article uses qualitative data (participant-observation and interviews) to examine happiness talk in a university-based evangelical Christian organization (University Unity). Unity Christians claim that they are happier than non-Christians, but rather than viewing their happiness as a mental health outcome of their participation in a religious organization, I view it as a cultural phenomenon--a way of talking and thinking about their emotions. I show how Unity participants learn to think of themselves as happy, learn to adjust their emotional responses and view their managed emotions as authentic, and learn to link happiness to their moral selves. Unity's emotion work helps participants achieve happiness, but because it also disallows any negative emotions, such happiness is compulsory. One cannot be a Unity Christian if one is not happy. In Unity, then, happiness is a symbolic boundary--participants see themselves as happier (and more authentically so) than others--but this feeling is also material in the crafting of more complex moral boundaries in which happiness is both sign and cause of other kinds of ""goodness."" Happiness is an effective boundary not just because Unity Christians themselves want to be happy, but because most members of the middle class want to be happy, and because it builds on broader associations between happiness and morality.

,,,Beyond Educational Inequality in Czechoslovakia,"This paper addresses questions of the applicability of the meritocratic thesis to the explanation of educational inequality in Czechoslovakia. I defend the hypothesis that ""non-meritocratic"" or even ""anti-meritocratic"" processes might have generated patterns of social fluidity almost identical to those based on meritocratic selection. The arguments backing this thesis come from comparative research in educational mobility and inequality, and from the first wave of the longitudinal survey ""Family 1989"" started in Czechoslovakia in January 1989, almost a year before the November revolution. This survey, among other things, dealt with strategies for life success among teenagers and their parents. A ""non-meritocratic"" hypothesis is discussed, which might explain the relatively strong direct effect of social background on educational attainment in Czechoslovakia and other socialist countries. The hypothesis is based on Bourdieu's concept of ""social capital"". It argues that, because of bureaucratic rules applied in admission policy, the spontaneous tendency of higher social strata to use their ""social capital"" and to pass on social advantages to their offspring in socialist countries seems to be less restricted by meritocratic competition than in advanced capitalist countries. Some preliminary results from the survey ""Family 1989"" show that this hypothesis might be plausible.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41133194,Czechoslovak Sociological Review,10.2307_41133194,Sociology,1992.0,0,1.0586924872768577e-05,0,0.0028606008272618055,1,0.9991191029548645

The centerpiece of HIV prevention, safer sex, was a synthesis of epidemiological information and reflected both the gay community's desire to protect the sexual freedoms gained in its political struggles during the 1970s and its practical understanding of sexual urgency and how that sexual freedom could be protected. The interplay between epidemiology and the gay community's vernacular knowledge was marked by an interplay between two different forms of knowledge and authority. The gay male community and the public health establishment both deployed their cognitive and political resources in a struggle to define the transmission factor and to devise preventative strategies. The gay community sought to protect the sexual freedom it had just barely achieved ten years earlier. The public health establishment tried to identify the populations within which AIDS seemed to originate and control them - short of massive quarantine, a politically awkward resolution of the public health problem.

,,,A Radical Demand Effect,"Numerous scholars consider the economic origins of the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century US married women’s property acts. Researchers investigate how economic downturns and women’s inroads into business spurred lawmakers to reform property laws to give married women the right to own separate property. Such economic explanations, however, are only a partial story. Our investigation reveals the important role of women’s collective activism in winning these legal changes. Women mobilized for property rights often as they pressed for voting rights and, in one case, as they campaigned for an equal rights amendment. We examine circumstances leading to passage of married women’s property acts in seven states to show that as women mobilized for property rights alongside voting rights or a broader equal rights law, a radical demand effect unfolded. Lawmakers often considered demands for woman suffrage or an equal rights amendment as more far-reaching and thus more radical and threatening. Such feminist demands, then, provided a foil for property-rights activism, and the contrast led lawmakers to view property demands as more moderate. In addition, as they pressed for these combined reforms, women often engaged in hybrid framing that allowed them to moderate their demand for property reforms by linking their property goals to beliefs already widely accepted. The confluence of these circumstances led political leaders to deem property changes as more moderate and acceptable in an effort to steer feminists away from their radical goals. In the end, the radical demand effect created a political opportunity for passage of the married women’s property acts.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/90017030,Social Science History,10.2307_90017030,Sociology,2014.0,1,0.9969632029533386,1,0.9951358437538147,0,0.007750336080789566

,,,Kin and Nonkin under Collective Threat: Israeli Networks during the Gulf War,"This study presents a rare glimpse of how people use their social networks during a mortal threat. In surveys done around the time of the 1991 Gulf War, we asked residents of metropolitan Haifa, Israel, to tell us from whom they received support during the missile attacks. The results show that Israelis relied more on kin than they did in their everyday networks. However, how much they relied on kin varied by type of support, specifically by whether the help was the comfort and advice of conversation - often provided by friends - or was more immediate and direct aid - overwhelmingly provided by kin. While we reinforce earlier findings that people turn to kin in crises, we also show that nonkin provide a specific form of social support.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2580298,Social Forces,10.2307_2580298,Sociology,1994.0,0,1.4875161468808074e-05,1,0.9996395111083984,0,0.0026111495681107044
,,,A CLUSTER OF CONTRADICTIONS: THE POLITICS OF MIGRATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION,"The increasing scale of transnational migration is sociologically one of the most interesting features of contemporary life, not least because of the analytical challenges posed by the complexity of this phenomenon. The aim of this paper is to explore the contradictions inherent in policy approaches to migration in the EU – the logic of the market is weighed against welfare protectionism; welfare and labour market regulation against demands for cheap labour; national resource concerns against transnational rights. The outcome is presented in terms of an increasingly complex system of civic stratification, which raises a further set of contradictions; discriminatory exclusion alongside assertions of equal treatment. The implications of these cross-cutting pressures for a sociological understanding of migration are considered throughout, and doubt is cast on the validity of any single overarching perspective.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42857904,Sociology,10.2307_42857904,Sociology,1997.0,0,7.765806367387995e-05,1,0.9998235106468201,0,0.3885138928890228
,,,CONTINUITIES AND VARIATIONS IN EVERYDAY CONCEPTUAL COMPONENTS OF CLASS,"A variety of conceptual components of everyday actors' class schemes (the number, size, notation and characteristics of the classes perceived, the determinants of class, the nature of class relationships and the possibility, means and desirability of class mobility) are located in terms of occupation and analysed according to eight 'typical' Class Schemes (outlined in a previous issue of this journal). This is undertaken in order to demonstrate the extent of agreement and disagreement over these aspects of everyday definitions of class and to convey the degree to which the ideal-typical formulations reflect the views actually expressed by respondents. This is deemed necessary because of the tendency to confuse the abstractive nature of such types with their empirical or generalizing function. The findings, while broadly consistent with much previous research, reveal a complexity that demands a rethinking of a number of sociological practices and stereotypes. In particular, they provide empirical support for the typology of Class Schemes while showing the ways in which certain conceptual components of class are held in common. On the other hand, they also demonstrate the variations in social meaning applied to such concepts as 'money'.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42851628,Sociology,10.2307_42851628,Sociology,1975.0,0,0.010880695655941963,1,0.9999679327011108,1,0.7503021955490112

Some progress toward such refinement is evident in recent research on the measurement of positional power.

,,,URBANIZATION AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS IN NIGERIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIAL POLICY,"The article examines mental health problems occuring in Nigeria's urban areas in association with the process of change in the social and economic spheres. Adaptational failures from the standpoint of mental health are assumed not only by the prevalence of mental and psychosomatic disorders, but also by such indices as rate of crime, delinquency, drug addiction, alcoholism, illegitimacy, and prostitution. In a context in which most of the traditional social supports are no longer relevant or operative, the failure of urban centers inNigeria to provide substitutes creates unexpected problems of mental stress, personal dis orientation, and social dis organization for many urban Nigerians. Various community mental health programs if conceived as programs for prevention as well as treatment, must be introduced to engage with the social system in such a way as to modify stresses and build into the Nigerian cities not only treatment but also social and political processes to ameliorate their own conditions. Employment opportunities must also be provided for the city dwellers, which have to be brought into equilibrium with the number and quality of job seekers. This requires rapid industrialization and agricultural development.

The transitory period will be very confused. The labor market will be segmented and the development of individual segments will be uneven. Already now, new temporary borderlines are being created. The transformation of the post-communist countries is being carried out in a period when the era of market regulation is over in the West and many securities of the labor market are being eroded.

,,,Sex and Race Differences in Mathematics Aptitude: Effects of Schooling,"The differential course-work hypothesis posits that intergroup differences in mathematics aptitude result from differences between groups in both the extent and type of in-school exposure to mathematics and to related quantitatively oriented courses. Differential course-work effects on gender differences in mathematics aptitude are ambiguous, and research on racial differences is limited. This article examines the extent of the reduction in sex and race differences in mathematics competence when accounting for course-work in high school. The findings indicate that the previously more-researched sex differences in mathematics competence may or may not be significantly reduced when course work is controlled, depending on which component of mathematics competence is measured. However, racial differences in all components of mathematics competence are significantly reduced when racial differences in exposure to relevant high school course work are taken into account. These findings imply that simply increasing the exposure of females to math-related high school courses may not be sufficient to reduce sex differences in all aspects of mathematics aptitude. However, standardizing the math (and related) curricula of blacks to that of whites could potentially improve all aspects of black students' mathematics performance.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/1388943,Sociological Perspectives,10.2307_1388943,Sociology,1986.0,0,1.3256687452667393e-05,0,0.025344958528876305,1,0.9995195865631104
,,,"Commercial Relations, Contract, and Litigation in Denmark: A Discussion of Macaulay's Theories",The concept of thematization-the process by which actors select a frame of reference for their communications-captures an aspect of dispute resolution that is fundamental to Macaulay's description of noncontractual commercial relations and to many recent dispute resolution studies. Thematization both describes the identification of events as relevant to relations between the parties and links these events to special resources and sanctions. In the thematization process managers apply their knowledge of commercial relations and of transaction structures to ensure freedom to choose between modes of handling matters. A pilot study of Danish firms illustrates the workings of the process. The author's preliminary analysis suggests that thematization within the firm determines how various forms of norms are applied at different times. Businessess continue to employ laws and litigation when other forms of governance of economic relationship fail. Thus law is still an important source of power in business.,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3053687,Law & Society Review,10.2307_3053687,Sociology,1990.0,0,0.00064345623832196,0,0.0002845710841938853,0,0.00010788421786855906
,,,Substance Use Disorders in a Sample of Iranian Secondary School Students,"Aims: The current research assessed the rate of substance use among Iranian secondary school students. Participants: 470 boy secondary school students selected randomly and were assessed. Measurements: A confidential questionnaire based on DSM-IV and a prior study was distributed, completed by the students and collected in the same sessions in 2001. Results: Their mean age was 13.6 yr (SD = 0.67) ranging from 12 to 14. Of the subjects 105 (22.3%) reported usage of substance (s) once or more sometime during their lives: tobacco 82 (17.5%) alcohol 32 (6.8%), opium 3 (-0.6%), hashish 1 (-0.2%), and heroin 2 (0.4%). Only 39 (8.3%) of the students were current substance dependent: 29 (6.2%) were tobacco dependent and 13 (2.8%) were alcohol dependent. Some were using more than one substance. Conclusions: Tobacco and alcohol were found to be the most prevalent form of substance use. Seeking pleasure, modeling and release of tension were the most common reasons for initial substance use. The most common reasons reported for current use were seeking pleasure, habit and release of tension, respectively. These findings can be implicated in planning preventive programs.

Results show clear influence effects of educational attainment and mental illness but no effects for physical disability. Social distance effects are present for mental illness and physical disability but not for educational attainment Results additionally show that stigmatizing attributes combine with task ability in affecting influence and also suggest that task ability may reduce social rejection. These results indicate that stigmatizing attributes combine with status markers in a way similar to previously studied status attributes.

It attempts to give a greater insight than hitherto into the work relationships of teachers in schools; concentrates on the consequences for self and role performance of teacher career experience, focusing particularly on teacher/headteacher interaction. Intraschool 'horizontal' and 'vertical' aspects of teachers' careers (particularly, 'the streaming of teachers') and associated moral careers are examined; and the formation of a 'cabal' and a 'clique' noted. This professional segmentation is linked with the streaming of children and the distribution of 'stratified knowledge' within the school, which are seen to guarantee distinctive pupil identities and educational careers.

Although Latinos are fast becoming the largest ethnic minority group, they remain an underresearched population. In this paper we contribute to the nascent field of Latino violence research by conducting an examination of Latino homicides in two U.S. cities. Methods. Direct access to homicide investigations unit files on over 1,800 homicide cases in two predominantly Latino cities (El Paso, Texas, and Miami, Florida) allowed us to collect a unique data set for our analysis of Latino homicide victim and event characteristics. Results. Similarities and differences in homicide patterns relevant to important policy and theoretical debates are discussed. For example, in both cities, homicides were overwhelmingly intragroup, and males comprised the majority of victims in four out of five types of homicide (intimate homicide victims were almost exclusively Latina). Despite similar employment, poverty, and family-structure characteristics for Latinos in both cities, important differences emerged (e.g., Miami's homicide rate was almost three times that of El Paso). Conclusions. The intraethnic variations in patterns of homicide we report challenge existing theories of criminal violence and demonstrate the value of using group-disaggregated data to examine both cultural and structural forces affecting violence.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42864388,Social Science Quarterly,10.2307_42864388,Sociology,2000.0,0,4.390465983306058e-05,0,0.0002650490205269307,1,0.9997801184654236
