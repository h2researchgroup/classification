2,,,,From Expectation to Experience: Graduates Entering a Large Corporation,"The paper reports a longitudinal study of new and recently recruited graduates to an oil company, to evaluate how initial expectations compared with experience, and how needs, interests and work activities changed over time post-entry. Results showed that new entrants had unrealistic expectations, especially of having more managerial job content than they were assigned initially, but this increased with subsequent experience to reach expected levels. Socialization effects were evident, especially by job function, but not by gender. The work orientations and job experiences of commercial and technical graduates developed on divergent paths over time, suggesting more positive personal growth over their early careers for the commercial graduates.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2488461,Journal of Organizational Behavior,10.2307_2488461,Management & Organizational Behavior,1991.0,0,3.273009497206658e-05,0,0.00022048040409572423,1,0.9888924956321716

The analysis suggests that this programme produces a number of conventional meanings within which specific messages about food are embedded. These findings indicate that television food programmes offer the hospitality provider important insights into the contemporary cultural formation of the consumer and into the ways by which key product concepts can be marketed, which can be of benefit to the hospitality industry. In addition, the categorisation of concepts and discourses upon which food programmes draw for their meanings offers a methodological and conceptual framework for future research of the genre.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/42919209,International Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_42919209,Management & Organizational Behavior,1999.0,1,0.9563668370246887,0,0.00505705364048481,0,9.099447925109416e-05
5,,,,Corporate Citizenship: Perspectives from India,"This paper explores corporate citizenship ideologies and practices in India. It is noted that business involvement in social welfare and national development has been a tradition in India. However, the traditional philanthropy or merchant charity of business in India has changed over time to become social responsibility of business and corporate citizenship. The paper presents examples of current practice of both indigenous and foreign businesses in India in order to examine the trends of corporate citizenship. It argues that these practices correspond to the social and economic systems in which companies are embedded and, thus, that these may be peculiar to developing-country contexts or else reflect the paradox of Western and Eastern approaches to corporate citizenship.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.2.107,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.2.107,Management & Organizational Behavior,2001.0,0,0.05993959307670593,0,0.0013853854034096003,0,6.509605009341612e-05
6,,,,The Teacher Stress Process: A Cross-Cultural Analysis,"A cross-cultural systems analysis was performed on teacher stress data from Canada and Sweden. The LISREL structural analysis was based on a conceptual model adapted from Kyriacou and Sutcliffe. Although the LISREL solution did not reach statistical significance it was concluded that the conceptual model in the essential features was corroborated by the LISREL analyses. Measurement errors, as well as the sensitivity of the used goodness of fit test (chi square) to the size of the samples was put forward as explanations of the failure to reach statistical significance for the LISREL structural solutions. Furthermore, it was argued that the heterogeneity of the teachers with respect to the stages of their professional careers should be considered in further research on teacher stress, to be able to capture the process aspects more adequately.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/3000130,Journal of Occupational Behaviour,10.2307_3000130,Management & Organizational Behavior,1984.0,0,8.87686383066466e-06,1,0.995257556438446,0,0.0030965085607022047
7,,,,Enantiodromia and crisis management: a Jungian perspective,"In this paper, using Carl G. Jung's psychological theory of types, we propose that the process of enantiodromia hinders decision-making in crisis management. This process produces a double reversal in the decisions and actions made by individuals: first, good and usual strategies are pushed to absurdity and second, archaic strategies, loaded with unconscious material, are substituted for the efficient and common ones. Providing a number of key definitions in analytical psychology, we explain the nature and the effects of enantiodromia with the help of diverse case analyses, and we propose several possibilities for managing the negative side of this process.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/26162510,Industrial & Environmental Crisis Quarterly,10.2307_26162510,Management & Organizational Behavior,1993.0,0,0.00012155811418779194,0,0.3811923861503601,0,0.0005407342687249184

9,,,,Bridging the Research—Practice Gap,"Management research often bears little resemblance to management practice. Although this research—practice gap is widely recognized and frequently lamented, there is little discussion about how it can be bridged. We partly remedy this problem in this paper by describing our experiences with the Network for Business Sustainability. Our experiences showed that the paradoxes underlying the relationship between research and practice make bridging this gap difficult. We argue that the reason why the research—practice gap endures is that bridging it is beyond the capabilities and scope of most individuals, and we call for the creation of intermediary organizations like the Network for Business Sustainability. We close by outlining some of the activities that can be undertaken by these boundary-spanning intermediary organizations, with the hopes of better aligning management research and practice.",external-fulltext-any,Academy of Management Perspectives,10.2307_23208286,Management & Organizational Behavior,,0,0.00044740329030901194,0,0.008836331777274609,0,0.00017743237549439073
10,,,,One Size does not Fit All Projects: Exploring Classical Contingency Domains,"Not many authors have attempted to classify projects according to any specific scheme, and those who have tried rarely offered extensive empirical evidence. From a theoretical perspective, a traditional distinction between radical and incremental innovation has often been used in the literature of innovation, and has created the basis for many classical contingency studies. Similar concepts, however, did not become standard in the literature of projects, and it seems that theory development in project management is still in its early years. As a result, most project management literature still assumes that all projects are fundamentally similar and that ""one size fits all."" The purpose of this exploratory research is to show how different types of projects are managed in different ways, and to explore the domain of traditional contingency theory in the more modern world of projects. This two-step research is using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and two data sets to suggest a conceptual, two-dimensional construct model for the classification of technical projects and for the investigation of project contingencies. Within this framework, projects are classified into four levels of technological uncertainty, and into three levels of system complexity, according to a hierarchy of systems and subsystems. The study provides two types of implications. For project leadership it shows why and how management should adapt a more project-specific style. For theory development, it offers a collection of insights that seem relevant to the world of projects as temporary organizations, but are, at times, different from classical structural contingency theory paradigms in enduring organizations. While still exploratory in nature, this study attempts to suggest new inroads to the future study of modern project domains.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2661507,Management Science,10.2307_2661507,Management & Organizational Behavior,2001.0,0,0.000265212613157928,1,0.5929131507873535,0,0.0013033845461905003

The trauma experienced is not simply a set of symptoms (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), but a major change in the person's ""assumptive world"", the way the self and the world around it is understood. Crisis intervention must focus on allowing victims to psychologically ""process"" the events and their reactions by assisting them to build frameworks of understanding within which their shattered assumptions and new perceptions of themselves may be ordered. Psychological debriefing is put forward as a model of crisis intervention which facilitates this process.

13,,,,Investigating Occupational Stress: A Methodological Approach,One of the main methodological difficulties in carrying out research in the field of occupational stress is the use of pre-designed health and behavioural questionnaires. This has the serious disadvantage of either not including important stressors at work or distorting the importance of those that are included. This article describes the use of the Repertory Grid technique in identifying sources and manifestations of occupational stress which overcomes this obstacle. A detailed description of the Grid technique as it was applied to air traffic controllers is provided.,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3004073,Journal of Occupational Behaviour,10.2307_3004073,Management & Organizational Behavior,1980.0,0,1.291019179916475e-05,0,0.11237218976020813,0,0.005385759752243757

In addition to the effect on relative factor cost of changes in the exchange rate, it is a change in strategic approach to the world market that has led German firms to invest rather than export. Managers' increased confidence in their ability to exploit globally their distinctive technical advantages is also important.

16,,,,Embracing Jazz: Exploring Audience Participation in Jazz Music in Its Birthplace,"Jazz is an American art form that has become a reflection of universal passions, emotions and the human experience. However, American audience participation for the art form is declining. New Orleans has long been heralded as the birthplace of jazz, and although jazz music can be heard at various venues as well as music festivals throughout the city, local audiences do not make up the majority at venues dedicated to jazz performance. This study examines barriers to audience participation for jazz music. Specifically, audience participation in New Orleans is explored using the Motivation, Ability, Opportunity model as a guiding framework. Empirical evidence, consisting of residents' insights concerning jazz and possible barriers to participation, was gathered via in-depth interviews. Further, drawing from the literature on consumer engagement and brand experience, a model is proposed to address how such barriers might be overcome through strategic marketing efforts that create meaningful and engaging jazz consumption experiences. Le jazz est une forme d'art américaine qui a su refléter les passions, les émotions et l'expérience humaine. Cependant, la participation du public américain à cet art est en déclin. La Nouvelle-Orléans est reconnue pour être le berceau du jazz, et bien qu'il soit possible d'entendre cette musique dans divers lieux de la ville tels que les festivals de musique, le public local ne constitue pas la majorité dans les lieux dédiés aux spectacles de jazz. Cette étude examine les barrières à la participation du public aux spectacles de jazz. En particulier, cette participation du public à La Nouvelle-Orléans est examinée à travers le modèle des motivations, des compétences et des occasions, lequel sert de cadre de référence. Les évidences empiriques, consistant dans les opinions des résidants au sujet du jazz et dans les possibles barrières à la participation, ont été recueillies au moyen d'entrevues en profondeur. De plus, s'appuyant sur la littérature concernant le comportement du consommateur et l'expérience de marque, un modèle indique comment de telles barrières peuvent être surmontées grâce à l'élaboration de stratégies de marketing susceptibles de créer des expériences de consommation du jazz signifiantes et engageantes. Eljazz es una forma de arte estadounidense que se ha vuelto el reflejo de pasiones, emociones y experiencia humana universales. Sin embargo, la participación del público estadounidense en esta forma de arte va disminuyendo. En Nueva Orleans, la proclamada cuna deljazz, sigue oyéndose esta música en varios lugares y festivales sin embargo en estos eventos dedicados al jazz el público local es minoría. En este estudio se analizan los obstáculos para la participación en la música jazz, y más específicamente, la participación del público de Nueva Orleans utilizando el modelo Motivación, Capacidad, Oportunidad como marco rector. Los datos empíricos se recogieron mediante entrevistas detalladas en las cuales se buscaban la percepción de los residentes del jazz y los posibles obstáculos a su participación. Basándose en la documentación sobre el compromiso del consumidor y la experiencia de marca, se propone un modelo que permita vencer dichos obstáculos mediante esfuerzos estratégicos de mercadotecnia que lleven a la creación de experiencias valiosas y atractivas de consumo de jazz.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/24587099,International Journal of Arts Management,10.2307_24587099,Management & Organizational Behavior,2013.0,0,0.00021006364841014147,0,0.0007514323806390166,1,0.9910741448402405
17,,,,Risk Communication And Transport Of Dangerous Goods: Extending Experiences From Industrial Installations In The European Community,"A European Economic Community directive, commonly known as the ""Seveso Directive,"" regulates industrial production and storage where dangerous substances are present in quantities above a given threshold. Among other requirements, it prescribes that information be provided to persons liable to be affected by a major accident. To the contrary, there is no regulatory framework similar to the Seveso Directive concerning the transport of dangerous goods, and consequently no risk communication provisions are in force. Such divergence in regulating the risk connected with dangerous substances constitutes the basis for the paper. First the paper outlines the EC legislation for industrial installations, then it examines the different transport modes for dangerous goods. Subsequently, taking into consideration the different organizational settings and target populations, it discusses the possibility of establishing risk communication requirements and procedures for the transportation of dangerous goods, similar to those required for chemical installations.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/26162277,Industrial & Environmental Crisis Quarterly,10.2307_26162277,Management & Organizational Behavior,1994.0,0,2.787041557894554e-05,0,0.00023785537632647902,0,0.0003502041508909315

21,,,,The Gendered Stereotype of the 'Good Manager' Sex Role Expectations towards Male and Female Managers,"In the past 30 years, U.S. and international studies have shown that societal expectations of the 'good manager' are closely related to the male stereotype. However, it is not clear, whether this stereotype is the same for men and women alike in managerial positions. The results of a German study with 625 students and 376 professionals participating between 1997 and 2005 are presented in the short note below. The main findings of the study are: 1. Female managers are expected to conform more closely to male stereotypes than are male managers. 2. Higher expectations are set from women and respondents with practical experience than from men and those who are inexperienced. 3. The most recent trend shows that male stereotypes increasingly dominate over female stereotypes.

24,,,,Managerial Resistance to Change: Romania's Quest for a Market Economy,"This exploratory investigation relates traditional theories on resistance to change to privatization of the Romanian economy. The authors identified several ""inhibitors"" which have served to stall Romania's attempts to achieve a free-market economy. While a lack of practical training in western-style management practices may be a limiting factor, Romanian managers are generally open to change. However, they are still deeply rooted in the thought processes instilled during Romania's command economy and a belief that the size and economic importance of their firms will serve as buffers against the ""agents of change"". To the extent that change is viewed as a threat to their personal interests, resistance can be expected. The question, ""what is in it for me?"", must be satisfactorily addressed if Romanian managers are expected to become active partners in implementing necessary changes. In dieser Untersuchung wird dargestellt, welche Relation zwischen Privatisierungsprozessen in der Rumänischen Wirtschaft und klassischen Theorien über den Widerstand gegenüber Veränderungen besteht. Die Autoren haben einige ""Hemmschuhe"" entdeckt, welche Rumäniens Bemühungen um eine freie Marktwirtschaft behindern. Während ein Mangel an praktischer Erfahrung mit westlicher Unternehmensführung ein solcher hemmender Faktor ist, liegt doch bei rumänischem Managern eine prinzipielle Bereitschaft zu Veränderungen vor. Trotzdem sind sie noch fest verwurzelt im Gedankengut, welches zu Zeiten der Rumänischen Planwirtschaft herrschte.

Whereas numerous instruments are used in practice for the ecological assessment of products and processes, a gap still has to be closed by developing social life-cycle assessment procedures. Based on the principles of the BASF eco-efficiency analysis on the one hand, and a product-related specification of the social sustainability dimension on the other hand, a social life-cycle assessment procedure has been developed which is now to be tested and discussed.

29,,,,"A Multi-dimensional Analysis of Managers' Power — Functional, Socio-political, Interpretive-discursive, and Socio-cultural Approaches","Managers' power within organisations has been analysed by several approaches: Orthodox management and organisation studies ('functional approach'), Critical Management Studies ('socio-political approaches'), interpretive, discourse-oriented and constructivist concepts ('interpretive-discursive approaches'), and anthropological, socio-psychological and sociological approaches ((socio-cultural approaches'). In organisational reality functional, socio-political, interpretive-discursive, and socio-cultural aspects are closely related and intertwined. However, because of division of intellectual labour, probably more because of different worldviews, researchers often make use of these approaches quite selectively.Such focussing has its advantages but also weaknesses. This paper therefore argues that it often helps to investigate complex phenomena such as managers' power in multi-dimensional ways.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41783630,Management Revue,10.2307_41783630,Management & Organizational Behavior,2009.0,0,0.011639832518994808,0,0.0617966502904892,0,0.00016447847883682698
30,,,,Restraining opportunism in hotel management contracts,"Management contracts are widely used throughout the world as a mechanism for separating the ownership of hotel properties and their management. The research reported here concerns how Thai hotel owners seek to control the international hotel chains where properties are operated under hotel management contracts (HMCs). Adopting agency theory, the research findings reported here suggest that restraints against agent opportunism tend to focus on two key aspects: contractual controls and operational controls. Additionally, the findings also suggest that the outcome control needs to be viewed as a priority for effectively controlling hotel management companies when using HMCs.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23745455,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23745455,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,0,0.00012438312114682049,0,0.00017300914623774588,0,0.00012204278027638793
31,,,,Aspiration Performance and Railroads' Patterns of Learning from Train Wrecks and Crashes,"We link two influential organizational learning models-performance feedback and experiential learning-to advance hypotheses that help explain how organizations' learning from their own and others' experience is conditioned by their aspiration-performance feedback. Our focus is on learning from failure; this kind of learning is essential to organizational learning and adaptation, and a necessary complement to studies of learning from success. Our analysis of U.S. Class 1 freight railroads' accident costs from 1975 to 2001 shows that when a railroad's accident rate deviates from aspiration levels, the railroad benefits less from its own operating and accident experience and more from other railroads' operating and accident experiences. These findings support the idea that performance near aspirations fosters local search and exploitive learning, while performance away from aspirations stimulates nonlocal search and exploration, providing a foundation for constructing more-integrated models of organizational learning and change.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/25146107,Organization Science,10.2307_25146107,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,0,2.9093760531395674e-05,0,0.0005985524039715528,0,0.016368303447961807

That is, the credit market is monopolistic. Mamy literatures studying the main-bank system in Japan use this idea. However, some empirical evidences suggest that there seem to exist multiple financial intermediaries in the credit market. This implies that we have to take into account such a situation.

34,,,,Interfirm Rivalry and Managerial Complexity: A Conceptual Framework of Alliance Failure,"Empirical research indicates that more than half of strategic alliances fail, and the outcomes of alliance failure can be devastating. Despite the increased concern about managing strategic alliances, the field still lacks a theoretical framework to describe the conditions and dynamics leading to the failure of strategic alliances. This paper attempts to distill, derive, and integrate theories across different disciplines into a unified framework that offers a better understanding of alliance failure. The conceptual framework focuses on two primary sources of alliance failure: interfirm rivalry and managerial complexity. We propose that strategic alliances fail because of the opportunistic hazards as each partner tries to maximize its own individual interests instead of collaborative interests. Also, strategic alliances fail because of the difficulties in coordinating two independent firms (i.e., coordination costs), and in aligning operations at the alliance level with parent firms' long-term goals (i.e., agency costs). The paper extends the theoretical framework by looking into a process model of alliance development and failure.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640395,Organization Science,10.2307_2640395,Management & Organizational Behavior,2001.0,0,0.00010200314136454836,0,0.008139270357787609,0,0.01121773011982441

36,,,,Forecasting and evaluating the tourist hotel industry performance in Taiwan based on Grey theory,"Although Grey theory is extensively adopted to construct the forecasting models for evaluating organisational performance, it is rarely used in the hotel industry. This study draws on the GM(1,1) model to accurately predict the coming year's output value and on Grey relational analysis to select the best-performing hotels in Taiwan. Measures of hotel performance — including profit before tax, ROI before tax, revenue per employee, REVPAR, revenue per square meter, and occupancy rate — were collected from the Tourism Bureau in Taiwan. These data contain the performance of 56 international tourist hotels in 2002 and industry data from 1992 to 2005. Results in this study indicate that four-point GM(1,1) is the best model for predicting output value in the future.

37,,,,Managing local tourism: Building sustainable tourism management practices across local government divides,"Increasingly, the challenge for local government in managing tourism is not in preparing plans and policies or undertaking new initiatives but in collaborating across internal organisational silos and across artificial administrative boundaries to provide a more integrated approach. The Managing Local Government Master Class was a programme designed to develop a 'joined-up' integrated approach to local government tourism management. This article outlines the Master Class approach within the increasingly complex context facing Australian local governments, and discusses two applications in Northern Rivers, NSW and Perth's Eastern Metropolitan Region.

Often, strong disagreement exists regarding relative merit of various projects competing for limited resources. This paper proposes a procedure for establishing a complete social preference ordering on the set of alternative projects when the group preference is fuzzy because of individual differences. An extension of current algorithms is developed and applied to a problem concerning public preferences for expenditures on civic projects in Houston, Texas. One thousand male and female heads-of-household were interviewed in depth to determine their preferences for investment among forty-one projects in the areas of social services, business and job development, public transportation, arts and leisure, and education.

Consequently, 67 fathers' (M age = 38.51 years) interrole conflict and marital adjustment are investigated. In addition, the moderating role of personality hardiness is assessed.

43,,,,"Employee Involvement And Market Orientation In A Transition Economy: Importance, Problems And A Solution","The literature on companies in Western Europe and the United States suggests that employee involvement in market oriented activity is critical to the successful operation of a business. Yet little systematic research has been conducted on employee involvement in the marketing orientation activities of companies in the transition economies of Eastern Europe. This article describes an exploratory study of 30 companies from three countries (two in Eastern Europe), which investigates the relationship between the extent to which market oriented activities were being implemented throughout the organization and the level of employee involvement. This article also explores the relationship between the degree of market oriented activity and the success of the business. Both of the above relationships were strong and significant. Results from the study lead to a major question regarding possible implementation strategies for the manager seeking to involve employees in the company's market orientation. Focusing on how managers might overcome the cultural barriers that may be preventing employees from accepting a more empowered role, we discuss three major cultural differences between the countries of Eastern and Western Europe. We conclude with a discussion of goal setting as a motivational technique that can be used within these cultural differences to encourage employee involvement in these companies.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40604214,Journal of Managerial Issues,10.2307_40604214,Management & Organizational Behavior,1998.0,0,5.990597401250852e-06,0,0.00024406264128629118,0,0.00013718630361836404
44,,,,"Chief Mohlomi: A Pioneer in Bridging Knowledge from Enterprises of Science, Business and Politics in Southern Africa in the 18th Century","The growth and specialization in knowledge production from enterprises of knowledge in the 20th century has led to a major diffraction of the intellectual terrain and a growing distance between knowledge boundaries. It is in this regard that the need to build bridges between various sources of knowledge has become more urgent than ever before. Is this gap worth filling? The answer is a resounding, yes, for a variety of reasons from a responsible leadership viewpoint: first, to generate understanding of leadership responsibilities needed for human progress and development between and across enterprises of knowledge; and second, to create a dialogue about crucial multi-disciplinary insights and knowledge needed to tackle complex development issues facing humanity. Drawing on lessons largely from southern Africa in the 18th century, the paper presents Chief Mohlomi as a pioneer in applying a unity of knowledge approach regarding the enterprise of science, business and of politics for human progress and development. The chief led and set in motion what McIntosh (2013) dubbed “the necessary transition” for transformative change towards a just and sustainable southern Africa during the 18th century.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.60.101,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.60.101,Management & Organizational Behavior,2015.0,0,0.00022611269378103316,1,0.9998928308486938,0,0.00019692124624270946
45,,,,A Homogeneous Distribution Problem with Applications to Finance,"We consider the problem of determining the cumulative distribution function and/or moments of the optimal solution value of a nonlinear program dependent upon a single random variable. This problem is difficult computationally because one must in effect determine the optimal solution to an infinite number of nonlinear programs. Bereanu [6] has provided an algorithm to solve the distribution problem in the linear case based on extensions of the methods of parametric linear programming. (See also [2], [3], [4], [5], [12] for the analysis of more general linear programs.) This paper presents an extremely simple algorithm to solve the problem in the special case when all functions in the nonlinear program are homogeneous. In this instance the infinite class of optimal solutions are known linear homogeneous transformations of the optimal solution to a single nonlinear program. The distribution function may then be determined by substitution of an easily calculated variable into the distribution function of the random variable. The results are useful in the solution and analysis of a number of financial optimization problems.

49,,,,Thompson Technology Construct and Executive Compensation,"Based upon a study of 135 American firms, this paper reports the finding of the relationship between executive compensation, company sales and profits classified according to the ""technological taxonomy"" developed by the late James Thompson. To him, technology was the basis on which organizations can be studied regardless of properties such as size, goals, product-market scope. Regression analysis lent some support to the view that the classic variables - sales and profits - as measures of performance are not adequate to explain executive compensation in the United States companies. When large numbers of firms are studied in groups based upon a commontechnological thread, one finds that both sales and profits tend to exert influence on compensation but in different degrees. This exercise does indicate that there is merit in employing technology as a key independent variable to separate out firms and place them in homogenous subsets. Furthermore, there is definitely a need for a search of other variables. We suggested W and Q - W being the wealth possessed by the executive in the form of stock ownership, and Q being an executive quotient or an index of the sum of perceived abilities of the executive by those who are in a position to determine his annual compensation. /// Basée sur une etude portant sur 135 societes americaines, le present rapport montre les relations entre la re-munération des cadres, le chiffre d'affaires réalisé et les bénéfices, relations classifiés d'apres la ""taxonomie technologique"" proposée par James Thompson. Selon cet auteur les organisations peuvent etre analysées à l'aide du critère de la technologie utilisée et ce indépendemment de la dimension, objectifs et produits commercialisés. L'étude de corrélations montre que les deux variables classiques: chiffre d'affaires et bénéfices ne sont pas, du moins en ce qui concerne les sociétés américaines, de bons critères pour expliquer la rémunération des cadres. Lorsqu'on étudie un grand nombre d'entreprises classées dans des groupes technologiques homogènes, on constate, il est vrai, que les ventes et les bénéfices exercent une influence sur la rémunération, mais à des degrés variés. Cela montre que Ton peut effectivement considérer la technologie comme une variable indépendante pour classer les entreprises dans des sous-ensembles homogènes. De plus, l'étude a montré qu'il est nécessaire de dégager d'autres variables. L'auteur propose les variables W- étant les actions détenues par le cadre - et Q - un coefficient traduisant la somme des capacités attribuées au cadre par ceux qui fixent sa rémunération annuelle. /// Auf der Grundlage einer Untersuchung von 135 amerikanischen Unternehmen wird im vorliegenden Beitrag über die Beziehungen zwischen Angestelltenentlohnung, Uhternehmensumsatz und Unternehmens-gewinn berichtet.

Dabei stellt sich Technologie als we-sentliche unabhangige Variable zur Klassifikation von unterschiedlichen Firmen heraus. Daneben zeigt sich die Notwendigkeit, weitere Variable zu diesem Zweck ausfindig zu machen. W und Q, nämlich das Vermö-gen des höheren Angestellten in Form von Aktien und der sog.
