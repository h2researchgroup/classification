,,,Averting Expected Challenges Through Anticipatory Impression Management: A Study of Hospital Billing,"Existing theory and research on organizational impression management focuses on how spokespersons use remedial tactics, following image-threatening events, to put their organization in the best possible light. By contrast, little theory or research has considered how organizations use impression management tactics to avert undesirable responses to upcoming events. This paper uses a qualitative and inductive study of billing procedures at three large hospitals to develop theory about how organization members use impression management tactics to fend off specific, expected challenges to organizational practices that are ambiguously negative. We found that hospitals use anticipatory impression management tactics to: (1) distract, diminish, or overwhelm patients' attention to hospital charges; and (2) to induce emotions that lead patients to simplify their information processing of those charges. Hospitals appear to use such anticipatory obfuscations both to fend off patients' initial challenges and to prevent their existing challenges from escalating. We discuss these findings in terms of their contributions to theories of symbolic management, social influence, and routine service encounters.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2640422,Organization Science,10.2307_2640422,Management & Organizational Behavior,1998.0,1,0.9969891905784607,0,0.0005817821947857738,0,0.0013747219927608967
,,,CONTEXTS AND CORPORATE VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIORS: Examining the EPA's Green Lights Voluntary Program,"Why do an increasingly large number of firms choose to spend their own money and resources to protect the environment beyond the extant regulatory requirements? This article addresses this question by examining the EPA's Green Lights (GL) voluntary program in which a firm's policy makers made an early commitment to limiting greenhouse gases through the installation of energy-efficient lighting technology in its facilities. Two theoretical perspectives—resource-based theory and neo-institutional theory—are adopted to investigate the contexts by which a firm is encouraged to undertake voluntary environmental actions and evaluate environmental strategies associated with them. Accordingly, the authors focus on two major contexts: market contexts in which a firm adopts voluntary actions as a strategic response to market pressures and to advance competitiveness; and institutional contexts in which a firm takes voluntary postures as a strategic response to institutional pressures, to obtain institutional legitimacy and weaken regulatory scrutiny. The research results partially support both contexts and their associated strategic behaviors.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/26161964,Organization & Environment,10.2307_26161964,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,1,0.9999685287475586,0,0.032635923475027084,0,6.951316026970744e-05

,,,Institutional Change in Italian Museums: Does the Museum Director Have a Role to Play?,"Consistent with the increasing managerialization of the Italian museum sector, in 1999 the National Museum of Science and Technology (NMST) was transformed into a private foundation. In 2001 the museum hired a director with managerial experience who adopted a market-oriented strategy. Recent findings in new institutional theory, the framework on which this study is based, show that organizational leaders can play a critical role in the pattern of adopting institutional changes/practices. Nevertheless, the conditions under which a museum director is able to adopt institutional changes/practices are still unclear and the effects of change on organizational, social and technical performance remain under-explored. The NMST is an ideal case for investigating these issues because of its recent transformation. This study found that the relationship among the director's background, the adopted strategy and institutional pressures created the conditions for adopting institutional changes/practices, with positive effects on both social and technical performance. Suivant la « managérialisation » croissante du secteur muséal en Italie, en 1999 le Musée national des sciences et de la technologie (MNST) est devenu une fondation privée. En 2001, il embauchait un directeur avec expérience de gestion qui a adopté une stratégie axée sur le marché. De récentes conclusions de la nouvelle théorie institutionnelle, dont s'inspire la présente étude, montrent que les leaders organisationnels peuvent jouer un rôle critique dans le type de réponse à la pression institutionnelle. Néanmoins, les conditions dans lesquelles un directeur de musée peut réagir à ce genre de pression restent obscures et les effets du changement sur le rendement organisationnel, social et technique restent à explorer sérieusement. Le MNST est un cas idéal pour l'étude de ces questions en raison de sa récente transformation. Cette étude a révélé que le rapport entre les antécédents du directeur, la stratégie adoptée et les pressions institutionnelles a créé les conditions nécessaires pour répondre à ces pressions et influencé positivement le rendement sur les plans social et technique. De la mano de la creciente transformación hacia la gestión comercial en el sector de los museos en Italia, en 1999 el Museo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (MNCT) pasó a ser una fundación privada. En 2001, el museo contrató a un director con experiencia en gestión, el cual adoptó una estrategia orientada hacia el márketing. Los avances recientes en el campo de la nueva teoría institucional, que forman el marco que da sustento conceptual a este trabajo, señalan que los líderes dentro de la organización pueden desempeñar un papel vital en la conformación de la respuesta ante la presión institucional. No obstante, no hay total claridad aún sobre las condiciones que deben reunirse para que el director de un museo pueda responder a la presión institucional, y queda mucho por examinar respecto de los efectos del cambio sobre el desempeño organizativo, social, y técnico. El MNCT, con su reciente transformación, se presenta como un caso ideal para la investigación de estas cuestiones. El presente estudio concluye que la relación entre los antecedentes del director, la estrategia adoptada y las presiones institucionales crearon las condiciones idóneas para responder a la presión institucional, generando efectos positivos tanto en el desempeño social como en el técnico.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/41064883,International Journal of Arts Management,10.2307_41064883,Management & Organizational Behavior,2006.0,1,0.9999926090240479,0,0.01236715167760849,0,0.0005071859923191369

In recent decades, values enacted in the societal context have increasingly been regressive, emphasizing aggressiveness, premodern belief, economics as an end in itself, great social inequality, and Earth as a resource pool for business activities. This trend is in contrast to the progressive values of cooperation, knowledge of and openness to alternatives, economics as means, limited inequality, and Earth as a home to be protected.

This is necessary because ethical norms have not tended to be given a significant role by conventional approaches to these problems, whether at the theoretical or the public policy level. The emphasis, instead, has been on government intervention and market mechanisms of various kinds. The paper provides a brief account of the new theoretical work on ethical norms, which shows how they can give rise to moral sanctions that provide powerful incentives for agents to exercise self-restraint. Drawing on this work, the paper presents a preliminary account of how ethical norms may be able to play a powerful role in addressing corporate governance and corporate responsibility problems.

Commodification and the Construction of an Occupational Mandate,"This study examines how occupational mandates-the socially conferred right to perform a given set of tasks-are negotiated by nascent occupations. Because researchers typically examine occupational formation long after it has begun, they neglect activities that occur prior to the acquisition of key institutional supports. The commodification of work is one such activity. Work becomes a commodity when audiences deem a formerly unpaid activity worthy of remuneration. This study draws on ethnographic data to examine the strategic patterns of situated activity and interaction used by one fledgling occupation, emergency medical services, to convince key audiences that their work is indeed worthy of compensation. Strategies used to construct and communicate in situ impressions of expertise, consistency, fungibility, and contractual relations are examined.

This has left providers and researchers with an inadequate conceptual toolkit for improving safety. To rectify the resulting crisis we consolidate fragments of management research into a comprehensive and integrative framework of how patient safety is produced and sustained through safety culture. Safety culture involves actions that single out and focus safety-relevant premises and cultural practices that reduce harm. This entails (a) enabling, which consolidates the premises for a safety culture; (b) enacting, which translates consolidated premises into concrete practices that prioritize safety; and (c) elaborating, which enlarges and refines the consolidation and translation.

In this paper, detailed information about the operations of six Norwegian companies in three key markets (China, UK and USA) is used as the basis for an exploration of the extent to which, and how and why, companies combine clearly different foreign operation modes. We examine their use of foreign operation mode combinations within given value activities as well as within given countries. The study reveals that companies tend to combine modes of operation; thereby producing unique foreign operation mode ""packages"" for given activities and/or countries, and that the packages are liable to be modified over time— providing a potentially important optional path for international expansion. The data show considerable variation across cases; ranging from extensive use of mode combinations to a singular focus on a specific mode of operation.

,,,Understanding resort visitors through segmentation,"Tourist hotel resorts have been considered as indispensable elements in the major tourism industry component of accommodation for several decades. Tourist hotel resorts are sought after by various segments of domestic and overseas tourists all over the world for various holiday purposes. There have been several focused tourism research contributions over the last two decades about their location, life-cycle stages, service quality and management. Few researchers, however, have focused their research on the resort hotel guests' resort selection preferences, satisfaction by resort service, opinion on resort holiday and preference for quality of resort guest activities. This paper tries to fill this vacuum in the resort tourism literature by exploring the visitors' views on resort selection, satisfaction, opinion and preferences. The research attempted to profile 776 visitors holidaying in resorts in selected resorts of Australia through a well-structured, four-page questionnaire divided into five parts containing 18 questions focusing on their reasons for resort selection, resort satisfaction, resort opinion and resort preferences under subtitles. The research also focused on their gender, age, level of education, occupation, life-cycle category, residency, nationality, postcode, years of patronisation, intimate selection choices and willingness to recommend their experiences. An attempt was made to profile the resort visitors through a cluster analysis in order to understand the underlying dimensions on the basis of the above-mentioned factors, segmenting them into identifiable groups. Four discernable clusters of resort visitors and their distinguishing characteristics were identified on the basis of their demographics. Further, through a one-way ANOVA analysis the clusters are compared with each other for further understanding and clarity. The results shows that the gender factor does not have much influence whereas life-cycle, education and age have considerable influence in segmenting the resort clientele. The four clusters were correlated with the selection, satisfaction, opinions and preferences.

In general, employment law is considered to be a necessary framework which is, for the most part, non-obstructive yet at the same time nonsupportive. Negative judgements relating to dismissal protection referred to its possible prohibitive effects (in the context of new-hirings), company-internal effects (in the context of confrontations within the company) and preventive effects (in the context of the dismissal of personnel). The prohibitive effect in the form of the non-hiring of new employees or the turning to other forms of employment rather than full time is rather weak. The decision to avoid hiring new employees is dependent upon the personnel manager's perception of employment law and not so much on an economical framework or the characteristics of the organisation. The role of dismissal protection within the company is also quite limited. In particular, having been employed by the company for a long time is considered very important for business management reasons. The judgements of those responsible for personnel are not to be explained with clear situational variables such as the business situation of the company or the development of the company's number of employees. There seems to be, rather, quite a lot of leeway regarding the understanding of Employment law and that this is dependent on the personnel managers' competence in this area as well as other factors.

The practice of socio-technical design should respond to this failing by accommodating both environmental change and workers' confidence to cope with it. An attempt to make this accommodation, in a design for a model future steelworks, is described. The design incorporates principles such as anticipatory learning, a ""tent"" organization culture, a task oriented plant layout, a democratic governance system, local information systems, and dialectical decision making. It offers one answer to how careers within organizations, and organizations surrounding careers, can each influence the other while remaining adaptive to external change.

Attempts to control the situation encountered various obstacles: (1) insufficient preparedness; (2) rapidly evolving social conflicts and public demands; (3) complex, interwoven structures of competence; and (4) geographically fluctuating problem loads. Regression analysis indicates that the responses of lower-level administrations depended on the resources available to them, such as scientific expertise, measurement devices and administrative experience. The existence of local hazards and general risk perceptions also influenced crisis management.

,,,"CEO Narcissism, Audience Engagement, and Organizational Adoption of Technological Discontinuities","We examine the responses of major pharmaceutical firms to the advent of biotechnology over the period 1980 to 2008 to explain why established firms vary in their adoption of technological discontinuities. Combining insights from upper echelons theory, personality theory, and research on organizational responses to new technologies, we posit that narcissistic chief executive officers (CEOs) of established firms will be relatively aggressive in their adoption of technological discontinuities. We propose, however, that the effect of a CEO's narcissism on organizational outcomes will be moderated by audience engagement—the degree to which observers view a phenomenon as noteworthy and provocative—which varies over time. When audience engagement is high, narcissistic CEOs will anticipate widespread admiration for their bold actions and thus will invest especially aggressively in a discontinuous technology. Drawing from work on managerial cognition, we further hypothesize that CEOs' narcissism will influence their top managers' attention to a discontinuous technology, an association that will also be moderated by audience engagement. Finally, we suggest that managerial attention to the discontinuous technology will subsequently be reflected in company investments in the new technological domain. Results provide considerable support for our hypotheses and highlight the role of narcissism in the context of radical organizational change, the influence of audience engagement on executive behavior, and the effect of executive personality on managerial attention.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/43546650,Administrative Science Quarterly,10.2307_43546650,Management & Organizational Behavior,2013.0,1,0.9994582533836365,0,0.0004828195960726589,0,0.4643222391605377

,,,Diseconomies of scale: A study of development constraints in small tourism firms in central New Zealand,"Small tourism firms (STFs) in both industrialised and developing countries, are a rapidly expanding and dynamic sector of regional tourism industries. Small firm development is being touted as the path for enhancing local economies and delivering more appropriate development to marginal and/or peripheral social, cultural and physical environments. Small firms have been also linked to creative product development and innovative entrepreneurship. Ironically, the small scale of operation, the essence of its vibrancy, also acts as a severe and debilitating constraint to development with potential negative implications for the quality and consistency of the wider regional product. Attempts to improve performance and managerial expertise within the STF sector have often proved misguided and misdirected largely due to poor understanding of the issues affecting owner/managers. This paper examines the range of influences in the external institutional environment that affect the development of small tourism firms. These include government agency roles, policy infrastructure, managerial support, and relationships with the financial sector. The discussion draws on a study of the Centre Stage macro region of New Zealand to contribute to a more integrated conceptualisation through which effective policies that enhance rather than constrain the activities of STFs can be conceived and implemented.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/23743723,Tourism and Hospitality Research,10.2307_23743723,Management & Organizational Behavior,2004.0,0,0.12393543869256973,0,0.0012900806032121181,0,0.2035210132598877

,,,Environmental Contamination And Human Rights — Case Of Minamata Disease,"Minamata disease is methylmercury poisoning that occurred in humans who ingested fish and shellfish contaminated by methylmercury discharged in waste water from a chemical plant. A total of 2,255 persons have been diagnosed with the Minamata disease, as of January 1993, 1,096 have already died. In addition, about 10,000 persons are suspected of Minamata disease. What is the reason for this disaster that is unprecedented and unparalleled in the history of mankind? World War II ended in August 1945 with Japan's defeat. Japan was faced with the urgent need to restore its devastated land and rebuild its economy. Under these conditions, priority was given to industrialization at all costs. The rights of individuals were slighted because the government subsidized industry, and collaborated with it. Productivity and efficiency were valued above anything else. Safety and post-treatment technologies were ignored. Japan rapidly achieved economic development, but experienced many incidences of occupational hazards and environmental contamination. The most typical example is Minamata disease. People who suffer first from the damages of environmental contamination are always those who maintain close contact with nature, particularly children and the elderly. Minamata disease brought about tragic results because the patient's central nervous system was primarily damaged. People became acutely aware of environmental contamination when they learned that the fetus of a contaminated mother may suffer more serious damages.

,,,"Firm Strategy, Innovation and Consumer Demand: A Market Process Approach","Despite recent advances by economists such as Porter and those associated with the resource-based school, the economics of demand rarely features in discussions of business strategy. Porter and the resource-based school take the characteristics of demand as given, and place almost exclusive emphasis on the role of supply-side factors in formulating strategy. Scholars in strategic marketing, by contrast, recognize the importance of demand factors, but do not analyse them from an economic standpoint. Moreover, none of the important schools of strategic management attempts to explore the relationship between supply and demand in much analytical depth. In this paper, we adopt a market process approach to strategy formulation as a preliminary step towards rectifying these problems. First, we explore the factors that affect the economics of demand, particularly in innovative situations. Second, we adapt Lancaster's attribute analysis to show how the interaction between supply and demand can be represented from a market process perspective.

While those practices are rather traditional in nature and do not spring from the recent concepts of corporate social responsibility, they are nevertheless of similar nature. The survey analyses internal (human resources and the working environment), external (community involvement) and environmental practices (reduction of environmental impact, such as reduction of resource consumption and waste, recycling and the like) and finds that internal practices are the most common. External responsibility activities are less frequent as is concern for environmental issues. Medium-sized firms tend to be more involved in socially responsible activities than smaller firms. Major motivations are religion/ethics, the desire to have a motivated workforce, build relationships and increase profits. To a lesser extent, regulations also play a role. The main obstacles to involvement in external and environmental issues were lack of resources, lack of knowledge and the perception that there is no environmental impact.

,,,Creating Competitive Advantages through New Value Creation: A Reverse Logistics Perspective,"Conventional wisdom in value chain strategy assumes a one-directional flow of primary activities, starting from inbound logistics to operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and finally to service. Our recent study, extensive discussions with executives, and on-site visits suggest that this wisdom may not be complete for certain industries or products. Customers on average return about 6% of everything they buy. Companies need to view this as an opportunity to give this returns pile a new lease of life. Yet many companies are not used to thinking that the things they expel such as products, waste, and resources actually have value. In fact, few retailers and suppliers capture the wealth of information that is locked inside a box that has been returned to the warehouse. Elevating the returns process to a new marketing opportunity builds a loyal customer base and also attracts new ones. In this paper, we present a redefined value chain strategy that entails a closed-loop system for industries in which reverse chain activities (reuse, repair, refurbishing, recycling, remanufacturing, or redesign of returned products from the end user) may create additional competitive advantages for the firm. Firms that do not recognize the importance of an effective reverse logistics strategy as part of their value chain risk damaging customer relations and may seriously jeopardize their brand image and reputation. A good reverse logistics program can be a differentiator and provides a means of gaining market advantage. In our perspective, a redefined value chain should be a part of the overall business strategy for manufacturers or retailers who handle product returns.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/27747373,Academy of Management Perspectives,10.2307_27747373,Management & Organizational Behavior,2007.0,0,0.00012532365508377552,0,0.0004589684831444174,0,5.716103987651877e-05
,,,Cycles of Identity Formation in Interorganizational Collaborations,"In this article we consider how issues of identity may have relevance to the management of interorganizational collaborations, and the establishment and disestablishment on trust in such settings. The focus is on the forces for and against consistency and disruption of identity in collaborative settings and the process by which identities are formed and assigned to self and others. On the basis of emergent theorizing using data from a collaborative setting concerned with health promotion, we build up a picture of a complex, interwoven, and tangled mêlée of cycles of interaction in which the actions of participants are (consciously or subconsciously) at least partly determined by the identities that those participants assign to themselves and others and in which the identities are partly determined by the actions. The picture portrays identities as generally made up of a combination of social categories with different categories to the fore at any one time, so that any single actor might give a quite different sense of identity of any other single actor (or of self) on different occasions. The picture suggests that identities will be continually shifting but that sometimes identities will become crystallized for periods of time. These identities may become so deep rooted that they are seriously difficult to change, should that be deemed helpful to the progress of the collaboration. We argue that the processes of identity formation will affect almost every aspect of the nurturing that is the essence of productive collaborative practice.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40397570,International Studies of Management & Organization,10.2307_40397570,Management & Organizational Behavior,2003.0,0,0.07304757088422775,0,0.00023735244758427143,0,0.008391745388507843

Despite these gaps in performance, no vertically integrated outlet was separated until 1994, yet the few outlets that were eventually separated systematically improved their performance. We argue that the conversion of integrated outlets into franchised ones involved significant transaction costs, due to an institutional environment favoring permanent, highly unionized employment relations.

Second, it is to survey existing solution techniques, available only for a few of such constrained problems. Finally, it is to shed some light on yet unstudied problems by exploring possible extensions of some of the known solution techniques or discussing varying degrees of difficulties involved. In particular, the paper presents integer programming formulations of several new problems along with the results of applying linear programming relaxation methods.

,,,"Determining Organizational Effectiveness: Another Look, and an Agenda for Research","Concern with the effectiveness, productivity, efficiency or excellence of organizations is a subject that has motivated the writings of economists, organization theorists, management philosophers, financial analysts, management scientists, consultants, and practitioners. It has served as a unifying theme for over a century of research on the management and design of organizations, yet the empirical research has not contributed to the development of a universal theory of organizational effectiveness. In this paper we review the extent to which the components of a contingent behavioral theory of organizational effectiveness already exist, one that incorporates the paradoxes and tradeoffs inherent in real life organizations. We consider the problem of effectiveness measurement, and we propose a research approach utilizing a strategy of engineering organizational effectiveness which could lead to an inductive, applied, empirically-based theory of contingent organization design. In this context the engineering of organizational effectiveness has a dual purpose. For the organizations and their managers participating in the research, it refers to understanding, constructing and managing organizational activities in given contexts so as to achieve and maintain improved performance as measured by one or more situationally-determined criteria. In addition, to provide the empirical basis from which induction can proceed, the engineered events must be structured and implemented in such a way so as to facilitate theory construction and testing.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2631844,Management Science,10.2307_2631844,Management & Organizational Behavior,1986.0,0,2.3756590962875634e-05,0,0.000211919512366876,0,0.001404496026225388

Mentor characteristics and perceptions and characteristics of the relationship were hypothesized to be related to mentors' seeking information from their protégés. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that perceived appropriateness of mentor information seeking, perceived protégé competence, vocational mentoring functions and protégé influence contributed significantly to the prediction of mentor information seeking among the mentor sample; hierarchical distance, perceived appropriateness and mentor self-monitoring were significant predictors in the protégé sample.

However, very little is known about the impact of such interventions on employees' perception of trust directed towards their supervisors, on psychological empowerment and on the work performance-related behaviors. This study proposes a holistic social exchange-driven nomological network model to examine the role of subordinates' trust as the psychological state that mediates the employees' assessment of social structural interventions and their perception of psychological empowerment. Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is predicted to be the preferred outcome of this social exchange relationship. The hypothesized relationships are empirically supported with a sample of 374 dyad samples from employees of health care homes, the information technology department of an education organization and an organization that provides health services. Results indicate that subordinates' trust for their supervisors fully mediates the relationship between information support, social political support and psychological empowerment. The relationship between resources support, human-and innovation-oriented organizational culture and psychological empowerment is partially mediated. Results also indicate that organizational citizenship behavior is a significant outcome of psychological empowerment.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40604623,Journal of Managerial Issues,10.2307_40604623,Management & Organizational Behavior,2008.0,0,1.7086313164327294e-05,0,0.00018796241784002632,0,0.0006728855660185218

,,,The Italian Personnel Manager,"A character in search of an author. This is the Personnel Manager today. There is no congress, convention or seminar of Personnel Managers in which the problem of their professional ""image"" is not raised debated and discussed. To try and answer this type of question the ILO International Centre of Turin has conducted a survey in Italy. A mail questionnaire has been sent to the Personnel Managers of 700 Italian firms representing all types of firms, in size, sector of production and economic importance. Among the 110 answers received, 77,5% were from middle and small firms and 22,5% from large firms with more than 5.000 employees. 52% were from firms with a family controlled capital that had been founded before the first world war. Who is the Personnel Manager in Italy? From our answers, which mainly reflect the situation existing in the middle sized firms, he is a graduate from University (90%), from the faculty of law (50%), Economics (20%) or Social Sciences (15%) and he has attended some seminars on personnel administration techniques. The present situation, on the other hand, does not satisfy him and he asks for specialized courses in which labour legislation is matched with social sciences and economics. An interesting aspect of his family background concerns his father's profession. Italian Personnel Managers are more likely to have fathers who are professionals, managers or proprietors. This fact is much more relevant (60%) in the little companies than in the large (49%) and middle companies (35%). The white-collar occupations come next with 30% for the little firms, 35% for the middle, and 49% for the large firms. Labourers and peasants occupations come next with 5% for the little firms, 14% for the middle and 1% for the large firms. It would therefore appear from this survey that only individuals with certain family background characteristics are likely to become Personnel Managers. This is a fact which seems to be valid also for the Italian managerial class as a whole, according to other research work on the subject. Low average age and a rather high job mobility, also indicate that the occupation is open to the younger managerial generation in this country. There is a change in mentality on which age and education, as shown in the survey, have a large influence. The younger and more educated are the Personnel Managers, the more open they are towards new forms of personnel participation within the firm. A further indication of change is the interest shown by Personnel Managers for more extensive application of modern Personnel Administration Techniques. This indicates in practice a trend towards an increasing use of objectives, rational, quantitative, methods of selection, training, remuneration and career planning, which are by nature less influenced by personal feelings, family pressures, recommendations, obligations and other emotional factors influencing Personnel Management in a typical family-type firm. /// Un caractère en quête d'auteur: voilà le chef de personnel de nos jours. Il n'y a pas de congrès, d'assemblée ou de séminaire de chefs de personnel où le problème de leur ""image"" ne soit pas soulevé, débattu et discuté. Dans le but de trouver une réponse à ce genre de questions, le Centre International de Turin du BIT a organisé une étude analytique en Italie. Un questionnaire a été envoyé aux chefs de personnel de 700 entreprises italiennes représentant tous les genres de sociétés par rapport à leur grandeur, leur secteur de production et leur importance économique. Parmi les 110 réponses obtenues, 77,5% émanaient d'entreprises moyennes et petites et 22,5% de grandes entreprises avec plus de 5.000 employés. 52% émanaient d'entreprises avec un capital contrôlé par la famille et qui avaient été fondées avant la première guerre mondiale. Qui est le chef de personnel italien? Selon les réponses qui nous sont parvenues et qui reflètent, pour la plupart, la situation des entreprises moyennes, c'est un gradué d'université (90%), de la faculté de droit (50%), économie (20%) ou de sciences sociales (15%), et il a suivi quelques séminaires sur les techniques de l'administration du personnel. La situation actuelle, cependant, ne le satisfait pas et il s'intéresse à des cours spécialisés qui unissent la législation du travail avec les sciences sociales et l'économie. Un aspect intéressant concernant son parentage est le métier de son père. Il y a de grandes probabilités que les pères des chefs de personnel italiens soient des hommes de profession, des dirigeants ou des propriétaires. Ce fait se trouve davantage confirmé dans les petites entreprises (60%) que dans les grandes entreprises (49%) et les entreprises moyennes (35%). Ensuite, il y a les employés de bureau: 30% pour les petites entreprises, 35% pour les moyennes et 49% pour les grandes entreprises. Avec 5% pour les petites entreprises, 14% pour les moyennes et 1% pour les grandes, s'ajoutent les ouvriers et les paysans. Il résulte donc de cette analyse que ce sont plutôt des individus avec un certain fond familial qui tendent à devenir chefs de personnel. Selon d'autres recherches faites à ce sujet, cette constatation s'applique à la classe des dirigeants d'entreprises italiens dans son intégralité. Un âge moyen bas et une certaine facilité à changer de position indiquent aussi que ce genre d'occupation est ouvert à la jeune génération des dirigeants de ce pays. Il s'agit donc d'un changement dans la mentalité sur lequel l'âge et l'éducation -- comme il a été démontré dans l'étude analytique -- ont une grande influence. Plus les chefs de personnel sont jeunes et mieux ils sont éduqués, plus ils sont ouverts aux formes nouvelles de la participation du personnel à l'intérieur de l'entreprise. Une autre preuve du changement est l'intérêt démontré par les chefs de personnel pour une application plus extensive des techniques modernes de l'administration du personnel. Cela démontre, en effet, une tendance vers l'emploi accru de méthodes de sélection, de formation, de rémunération et de planification de carrière objectives, raisonnées et quantitatives, qui sont par leur nature moins influençables par les sentiments personnels, les pressions familiales, les recommandations, les obligations et d'autres facteurs émotifs qui influencent le management du personnel dans une entreprise du type ""de famille"". /// Führungskräfte im Personalbereich suchen heute zunehmend nach einer Art Selbstbestätigung durch den Spiegel der wissenschaftlichen Beschäftigung mit ihrem Berufsbild. Um in dieser Hinsicht ein besseres Urteil von Seiten der Forschung bereitstellen zu können, wurde in Italien eine umfassende empirische Studie durchgeführt, die 700 Firmen unterschiedlicher Branchen, Wirtschaftszweige und Größenordnung enthielt. Auf die Frage, wer heute die Personalführungskraft in Italien repräsentiert, wurde in 90% der Antworten das Kriterium des Universitätsabschlusses mit juristischer Ausrichtung (50%), mit wirtschaftswissenschaftlicher Ausrichtung (20%) und mit sozialwissenschaftlichem Schwerpunkt (15%) in Verbindung mit einer nachuniversitären Spezialisierung aufgrund von Kursen in Personalmanagement genannt. Die gegenwärtige Ausbildungssituation wird hingegen nicht als befriedigend bezeichnet, da sie eine Verbindung zwischen Arbeitsgesetzgebung und wirtschafts-und sozialwissenschaftlicher Ausbildung vermissen läßt. Ein wichtiger Gesichtspunkt im familiären Hintergrund des italienischen Personalchefs scheint des Vaters Beruf zu sein, der in der Mehrzahl der Fälle mit Akademiker, Manager oder Unternehmer angegeben wurde. Danach folgen das Berufsbeamtentum, Arbeiter und Bauern mit jeweils unterschiedlichen Verteilungen in Klein-, Mittel- und Großbetrieben. Diese Verteilung trifft, wie andere Studien gezeigt haben, im wesentlichen und allgemein auf die Berufsschicht der Manager zu. Das Zusammenfallen von niedrigem Alter und hoher Mobilität verweist auf das relativ niedrige Durchschnittsalter italienischer Personalführungskräfte. Letzteres mag auch ein Grund für deren allgemeine Gewerkschaftsfreundlichkeit sein, die wiederum auf einen Ansatz zum Wandel der italienischen Gesellschaftsstruktur in Richtung auf eine Integration der unterschiedlichen Klassen hindeutet. Weitere progressive Einstellungen sind eine Tendenz zur Mitbestimmung, eine vermehrte Anwendung moderner Personalverwaltungstechniken und eine grundsätzliche Hinwendung zu mehr Objektivität und Rationalität in der Personalbeurteilung und den damit verbundenen Beförderungs- und Belohnungssystemen. Ein wesentlicher Mangel scheint im immer noch zu stark begrenzten Aufgabenfeld gegeben zu sein, das offenbar nur wenig Autonomie und Entscheidungsfreiheit zuläßt und im großen und ganzen die Personalfunktion noch immer als Stabs- und nicht als Linienaufgabe gelten läßt.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40245524,Management International Review,10.2307_40245524,Management & Organizational Behavior,1975.0,1,0.9099966287612915,0,0.0003663086681626737,0,0.014158261939883232

The serious limitations of DSS are brought into focus and reference is made to those situations which cannot be easily handled by simulation models like DSS, in general. For the benefit of the practitioners, this paper describes how and by whom DSS can be used with facility. Finally, the overall effectiveness of DSS in improving management objectives is questioned.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2629629,Management Science,10.2307_2629629,Management & Organizational Behavior,1973.0,0,1.020786294247955e-05,0,0.0003180744533892721,0,9.189271077048033e-05

,,,A Mathematical Model of Dental Caries Used to Evaluate the Benefits of Alternative Frequencies of Bitewing Radiographs,"This paper describes the development of a mathematical model that can provide the basis for a decision support system to aid dentists (or patients) in making decisions about how often to perform (or receive) bitewing radiographs. The model, which describes the initiation and progression of approximal dental caries, is developed from an analysis of 4 to 13 sets of serial bitewing radiograph exams taken on over 700 individuals. Caries incidence is modeled as follows: (1) there is an underlying gamma distribution representing variation in an individual's expected annual number of new lesions; (2) an individual's distribution of new lesions in a year follows a Poisson process with expected value that can be thought of as having been randomly selected from the gamma distribution. Progression is modeled by assuming duration of carious lesions in each half of the dental enamel can be approximated by a piecewise exponential distribution. Using this model, we determine the relationship between when the next set of bitewing radiographs is performed and the probability carious lesions are detected before any lesions reach the inner half of the dentin. For high risk individuals with no unrestored enamel lesions from their last set of radiographs, bitewings should be scheduled yearly; for low risk individuals with no unrestored enamel lesions, bitewings could be scheduled every 2.5 to 3 years, though both of these conclusions depend on the patient's and/or dentist's attitude toward risk.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2632262,Management Science,10.2307_2632262,Management & Organizational Behavior,1987.0,0,8.92851676326245e-06,0,0.00032890771399252117,0,0.002338252728804946
,,,The Governance and Control of Voluntary Corporate Spin-Offs,"We investigate the role that a voluntary corporate restructuring can play in the design of efficient internal corporate control mechanisms. To this end, we examine the postrestructuring internal control practices in 78 voluntary corporate spin-offs that were completed between 1972 and 1987. We find that the selection of the new CEOs, the design of their compensation contracts, and the staffing of the boards of directors and their compensation committees in the spun-off firms can be seen as ex ante efficient. These governance and control practices, however, are not strongly related to the observed positive market reactions to the spin-off announcements. The results indicate that equity reorganizations facilitate the implementation of efficient internal governance and control practices, but that other factors must influence the share price reactions to the announcement of such voluntary corporate restructurings.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2486935,Strategic Management Journal,10.2307_2486935,Management & Organizational Behavior,1996.0,0,0.0004428603278938681,0,0.0008310371194966137,0,0.00013125025725457817

The paper analyzed reports of 20 China-based companies published in 2012 using a grounded theory approach. Analysis of the 1473-page data reveals that the Chinese organizations mobilize CSR in search of a new ground of legitimacy during the transition from planned to market economy. However, although economic efficiency is highlighted, with the embracing of social harmony, relational responsibilities, and hierarchical social structure, this notion of CSR resembles inheritance of a redecorated socialist past rather than conversion to liberal-democratic ideals. This research contributes to the development of a global CSR framework by questioning the neoliberal ideals as the taken-for-granted foundation of corporate social responsibilities. It also has practical implications for multinational corporations interested in exploring the Chinese market.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/jcorpciti.61.71,Journal of Corporate Citizenship,10.2307_jcorpciti.61.71,Management & Organizational Behavior,2016.0,1,0.9911298751831055,0,0.000674705021083355,0,7.80512418714352e-05

,,,Computer-Mediated Communication and Majority Influence: Assessing the Impact in an Individualistic and a Collectivistic Culture,"Strong majority influence can potentially harm organizational decisions by causing decision makers to engage in groupthink. This study examines whether and how computer-mediated communication (CMC) can reduce majority influence and thereby enhance the quality of decisions in some situations. To measure the impact of CMC on majority influence, three settings (unsupported, face-to-face CMC, and dispersed CMC) were compared. Matching laboratory experiments were carried out in an individualistic (the US) and a collectivistic culture (Singa-pore) to determine how the impact of CMC might be moderated by national culture. An intellective and a preference task were used to see whether the impact of CMC might be moderated by task type. The results showed that the impact of CMC on majority influence was contingent upon national culture. In the individualistic culture, majority influence was stronger in the unsupported setting than the face-to-face CMC and dispersed CMC settings. In the collectivistic culture, there were no corresponding differences. The results also revealed that the impact of CMC on majority influence was not moderated by task type. Instead, task type had a direct impact on majority influence. Regardless of the setting involved, majority influence was stronger with the preference than the intellective task. Besides demonstrating how cultural factors may moderate the impact of CMC, this study raises the broader issue of cultural relativism in current knowledge on CMC.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/2634714,Management Science,10.2307_2634714,Management & Organizational Behavior,1998.0,0,0.18671822547912598,0,0.0023135903757065535,0,0.0003839092387352139

Although the amount of research on the internationalization process of service industries is growing, investigations on the international lodging industry still lack sufficient research, particularly in relation to emerging economies. This paper aims to fill this gap by conducting an investigation into multinational lodging firms that have started operations in Brazil. It intends to determine whether multinational lodging firms follow any temporal, geographical, or entry mode patterns when investing in an emerging market. The findings show that lodging firms in Brazil have followed differing time patterns, but have followed a similar geographical scope. Non-equity involvement was the most favored form of involvement.

,,,Capital Budgeting and Indian Investment in Foreign Countries,"This study examines the capital budgeting practices of Indian companies with joint venture abroad. The research findings indicate that the expansion of market for their products and taking advantages of further economic growth of host country were the main objectives for setting up foreign manufacturing subsidiaries by Indian companies. The expectation of higher profit was not the main motivational variable for this investment. The policy decisions are made jointly by the Indian companies and their foreign subsidiaries with varying degrees of say particular policy matter. The study suggests that when Indian companies plan to set up manufacturing subsidiaries in foreign countries, they analyse the various environmental risks in African and Asian countries which are not quite different from their own situation. This situation enables them to adjust quickly and provides an edge over other foreign investors. /// L'étude concerne la pratique de la gestion budgétaire des sociétés indiennes ayant des participations dans des sociétés étrangères.

Les décisions sont prises conjointement par les sociétés indiennes et leurs filiales étrangères qui ont, selon la nature de la question politique à trancher, une influence plus ou moins grande. II semble que lorsque les sociétés indiennes étudient les possibilités de création de filiales industrielles à l'étranger, elles analysent les facteurs de risques dans les pays africains et asiatiques de la même manière qu'elles le font pour leur propre pays.

Results corroborated these expectations and showed a significant positive correlation between supervisors' use of sanctions and ratings of unit performance by higher level managers.

,,,Information and Decision Systems for Production Planning,"Bowman [5] and others have proposed that regression models derived from a manager's past behavior can serve as a basis for future managerial decisions. This paper is concerned with a comparison of this approach to more traditional modes of decision making (intuition and mathematical optimization models) in an aggregate production scheduling context under various forecast error and forecast horizon environments. The regression models developed were also used to test Bowman's ""Management Coefficients"" theory at the axiomatic level, as well as to examine intuitive decision processes. To do this required verification that the regression models accurately specified an individual's decision process. A verification procedure, based on the concept of predictive testing, was used conjointly with statistical goodness of fit and cross validation to validate the regression models. The experimental results (1) supported Bowman's hypotheses, and (2) indicated the effects of forecast error and horizon length on the performance of the three decision making modes and on the formation of intuitive scheduling strategies.

Three conditions on relative costs and probability distributions are identified under which no financial slack should be raised. If those conditions are not met, then under one set of reasonable assumptions the optimum amount of slack will be more than the largest possible future need.

The first objective is to examine and see how effective the currency futures market has been in hedging the foreign exchange risk. In the hedging process one must decide how much of the exposure needs to be hedged. Contrary to the traditional belief, Shapiro and Rutenberg suggested that the financial officer of an MNC must hedge less than the total amount of exposure. Therefore, the secondary objective of this paper is to determine the optimal proportion of exposed spot position that must be hedged in the futures market. The spread between the spot exchange rate and future rate, which is widely known as the basis, has a significant influence on the hedger's position. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of the basis and its change on the hedger's profitability.",https://www.jstor.org/stable/40227609,Management International Review,10.2307_40227609,Management & Organizational Behavior,1981.0,0,1.7336073142359965e-05,0,0.0012414793018251657,0,0.0009235782781615853

In this study, it was proposed that much of this variance can be captured by understanding the extent to which product design and process design are integrated in new program launches. A mailed survey of 43 domestic firms was used to test four propositions concerning product-process development practices. Significantly, it was found that firms using the more rare design-manufacturing personnel integrating mechanisms (engineering job rotation and mobility) have higher sales per employee. Results of a discriminant analysis show that firms benchmarking on product development practices, as contrasted with performance bench-marks, were significantly more likely to use both the rare and the more common forms of design-manufacturing integration (i.e., train personnel in new design, methods, have manufacturing sign-off on design reviews, and restructure, e.g., use teams). Significantly, these firms also report a greater proportion of degreed manufacturing engineers.
