    "@description: '''Loads and merges two datasets in preparation for classification model training. Saves final datasets for preprocessing and model training, one per perspective, each just with scores and raw text (to be preprocessed later). We're dealing with three theoretical perspectives in org. science (cultural, demographic, and relational) and two subject areas (sociology & management/OB, not differentiated here). The first dataset is of articles hand-coded by the author and Prof. Haveman, and it comes as a clean .csv file. This first contains lots of false positives (from the previous approach based on cosine measures), so it consists of mainly negative cases. The second dataset is of articles identified by Prof. Haveman as being foundation/definitive for each perspective. This comes as a list of citations, one per perspective, and requires some pretty heavy cleaning to match with articles in the main JSTOR articles dataset.'''"
